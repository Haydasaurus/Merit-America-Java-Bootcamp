# IntelliJ

IntelliJ IDEA is a popular IDE among Java programmers. JetBrain developed the product and first released it in 2001. It's available as a free _Community_ edition and in a subscription based _Ultimate_ edition. The IDE itself is written in Java and can be run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

While primarily used by Java developers, IntelliJ supports a wide variety of other popular languages, including:

-   Erlang
-   Groovy
-   Kotlin
-   Python
-   Rust

Git, as well as other versioning systems, have built-in support.

IntelliJ usage is built around the idea of projects. Each application and its various resources are represented by a project. The IDE refers to project settings as **project structure**. You can create, open, run, and test projects in IntelliJ.

You may also copy, move, add, and remove resources within any project. Working with source code is considered a separate task within the larger context of a project and its resources, but it is tracked along with any other changes to resources.
