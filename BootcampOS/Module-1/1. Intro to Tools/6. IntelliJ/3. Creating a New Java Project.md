# Creating a new Java project

Launch IntelliJ IDEA. When the Welcome screen opens, click **New Project**.

## Note: What if the welcome screen doesn't appear?
If a previous project opens rather than the Welcome screen, go to the main menu and select **File > New**.

From the list on the left, select **Maven**. Make sure the box labeled "Create from archetype" is _not_ checked, and click **Next**.

Finally, you'll need to fill in some basic properties for the project:

-   **Project name**: Specify the project name.
-   **Project location**: Specify the path to the directory in which you want to create the project. By default, the IDE creates a directory with the same name as the project.

Click **Finish** to create and open your project.
