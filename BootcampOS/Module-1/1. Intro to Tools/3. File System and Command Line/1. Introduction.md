# Introduction

Successful programming requires more than just understanding and writing code; it requires the ability to work with files. In its broadest sense, software development unites code with data. Programmers store code along with data and other resources such as configurations, pictures, and sounds in files.

You may already be familiar with the built-in file manager that comes with your operating system. The Windows file manager is File Explorer, and the one for macOS is Finder.

However, you might not be as familiar with using the **command line** to navigate folders and files. Many developers use the command line to perform tasks like navigating a file system, utilizing tools, and running scripts.

In this unit, you'll learn how file systems work and how to interact with them in a command line.
