# Welcome to Bootcamp OS

Congratulations on your decision to enroll in this coding bootcamp course. Before you learn how to code, you need to understand how you'll interact with the course materials and the software platform that delivers them. This type of software is known as a **Learning Management System** or LMS.

## What's an LMS?
An LMS is a software application used in educational courses and learning programs. It provides several functions such as delivery and grading of learning materials and reporting course progress.

## Bootcamp OS
The LMS platform you'll use in this course is **Bootcamp OS**. You'll use Bootcamp OS to access your reading materials, take quizzes, and submit your exercises. You'll find explanations for these topics later in this guide.

When you first log in to Bootcamp OS, you'll see the **curriculum overview** page. This page contains several elements:

-   The course you're enrolled in
-   One or more sections
-   One or more units in each section
-   Checkpoint average
-   Course progress

The following screenshot is a sample of the curriculum overview page. Your course and unit names may be different:

### Bootcamp OS terminology

-   **Unit**: A grouping of learning content for a single topic. Often contains reading material, a tutorial, a quiz, and a set of exercises.
-   **Section**: A grouping of related units.
-   **Course**: The term used to encompass all learning content for an entire class.
-   **Checkpoint**: The graded portion of a unit, typically the unit exercise. Not all units have checkpoints.
