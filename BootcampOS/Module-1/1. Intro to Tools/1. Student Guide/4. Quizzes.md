# Quizzes

Quizzes help you understand how well you've learned the learning objectives from the unit. Overall, they have no impact on your academic standing.

Each quiz typically contains 7-10 questions. These questions aren't focusing on your ability to memorize specific terms or details. Each question validates your comprehension of the reading material and the concepts applied in the tutorial.

Most quiz questions are one of these four types: multiple choice, short answer, "select all that apply", and placing items in the correct order.

As you submit each answer, you'll receive immediate feedback on whether your answer was correct. You may submit answers more than once until you get the right answer.

You can use the feedback you received on the quiz to help you identify which topics that you need to review before moving forward. Your instructor uses this feedback during the lecture to determine which topics require additional focus.
