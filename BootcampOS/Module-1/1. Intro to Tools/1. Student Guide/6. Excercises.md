# Exercises

Most of the units in this course include exercises that simulate the types of tasks you'll encounter as a software developer. Unlike the quizzes, exercises expect you to identify a programmatic way of solving a problem, often through logic and reasoning. You'll use information learned from the current unit as well as previous lessons to build your solution.

## Types of exercises
Throughout the course, you may encounter different types of coding activities:

-   **Individual assignment**: A lab-based activity that assesses your understanding of the objectives associated with a specific lesson.
-   **Programming projects**: A project, individual or group-based, requiring you to develop a technical solution that addresses a specific problem.

When you see or hear _scored exercises_, it refers to an individual assignment.

## How to access exercises
Your instructor will place these exercises in your student repository in Git. You'll learn about repositories and how to access them in the Intro to Tools: Git unit.

## Grading policy
Most exercises you complete during the course leverage a concept known in software development as _test automation_ to provide an automatic score. Test automation is the practice of programmatically testing code to verify its correctness.

If an exercise doesn't include automated tests, your instructor grades it after you submit it.

Exercise scores use the following scale:

-   **Not attempted (0 points)**: The code contains compilation errors, or no meaningful attempt was made to complete the assignment.
-   **Attempted (1 point)**: A meaningful attempt was made to complete the assignment that demonstrates a partial understanding of the concepts. For assignments with automated tests, at least 25% of the provided tests pass.
-   **Comprehension (2 points)**: The submitted solution demonstrates a substantial understanding of the concepts. For assignments with automated tests, at least 50% of the provided tests pass.
-   **Mastered (3 points)**: The solution submitted demonstrates a mastery of concepts and conforms to the best practices shown in the lessons. For assignments with automated tests, at least 90% of the provided tests pass.

You'll see your final score next to each unit on the curriculum overview page:

## Receiving feedback
Your instructor may provide additional feedback about the quality of the code submission. Their feedback will help you improve the clarity of your code or identify a more direct way to approach the solution and comes from years of professional experience.

You'll find applying their feedback makes you a better software developer.

## Asking for help
Depending on the topic, you may find some exercises take several hours to complete. When you find yourself stuck and unable to make progress, reach out for assistance.

Start first by posting a message in Slack to see if someone else has encountered the same issue. Explain your problem and include any approaches you've tried.

When you ask someone else for help, ask them if you can describe your thought process. While you shouldn't ask to see another student's solution, you can walk them through your code. As you do, try to explain what's happening on each line. The other person may be able to identify the bug so that you can fix it.
