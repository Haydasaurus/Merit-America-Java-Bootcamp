# A subclass "IS" its superclass

You can create a new instance of `GrandfatherClock` in a program:

```java
GrandfatherClock myClock = new GrandfatherClock();

myClock.tick();
myClock.tick();

String currentTime = myClock.getCurrentTime();
```

But what if you wanted to create a new `CuckooClock` in place of the `GrandfatherClock` later? To do that, you'd change the two references to `GrandfatherClock` to `CuckooClock`, the remainder of the code remains the same:

```java
CuckooClock myClock = new CuckooClock();

myClock.tick();
myClock.tick();

String currentTime = myClock.getCurrentTime();
```

However, because programmers strive to make as few changes as possible to their code, they'll find ways to change even less code than that. You can make the code more flexible by treating a `GrandfatherClock` or `CuckooClock` as a plain `Clock`:

```java
Clock myClock = new CuckooClock();

myClock.tick();
myClock.tick();

String currentTime = myClock.getCurrentTime();
```

Since a `GrandfatherClock` IS A `Clock`, then you can save a `GrandfatherClock` in a `Clock` variable. The same goes for `CuckooClock`. This lets you dynamically choose which kind of clock you want:

```java
Clock myClock;
if(choice.equals("cuckoo")) {
    myClock = new CuckooClock();
} else {
    myClock = new GrandfatherClock();
}

myClock.tick();
myClock.tick();

String currentTime = myClock.getCurrentTime();
```

If you think about it, inheritance is very powerful. You could define different kinds of clocks, but use the same code to work with all of them. As long as your code knows how to work with a `Clock` object, it can also work with any object from a class that inherits the `Clock`.

## Every class is a `java.lang.Object`

In Java, every class is, either directly or indirectly, a subclass of `java.lang.Object` (or `Object`). If you define a class, but don't use the `extends` keyword to subclass another class, then your class is a direct subclass of `Object`. Look at the previous definition of the `Clock` class:

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    // Clock code here...
}
```

Because `Clock` doesn't explicitly extend another class, it extends `Object`. So a more complete picture of the class hierarchy follows:

`DigitalAlarmClock` IS A `AlarmClock`, which IS A `Clock`, which IS A `Object`. Therefore `DigitalAlarmClock` inherits all the properties and methods from all of its superclasses, including `Object`. This is also true of all the classes in the Java standard library, like [String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) and [ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html) .

This relationship of `Object` to all other classes is sometimes stated, "`Object` is the root of the Java class hierarchy." As a matter of fact, even the [Java documentation for Object](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html) says it this way.
