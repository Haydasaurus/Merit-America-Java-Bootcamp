# Protected access

When you learned about encapsulation, you learned about the `public` and `private` access modifiers. Properties and methods designated `public` are accessible from anywhere, while those designated `private` are only accessible within that class. When designing classes, and thinking about inheritance, the `protected` access modifier is a third option to consider.

## The `protected` access modifier

A property or method designated `protected` is accessible within the class like a `private` property or method and also within any descendants of that class.

Returning to the `InsurancePolicy` example, you might add a `coverageStartDate` property to the base class, since every kind of insurance policy has a date when its coverage begins. If you make that property `private`, though, the various child classes like `AutomotivePolicy` and `HomeownersPolicy` wouldn't have access to it. You could fix that by making it `public`, but then any class could access it, which violates the principle of encapsulation. So, you declare it `protected` like this:

```java
public abstract class InsurancePolicy {

    protected LocalDate coverageStartDate;

}
```

Now, `coverageStartDate` is available to any descendant of `InsurancePolicy`, but still encapsulated within the "family tree" which restricts other totally unrelated classes from using it.
