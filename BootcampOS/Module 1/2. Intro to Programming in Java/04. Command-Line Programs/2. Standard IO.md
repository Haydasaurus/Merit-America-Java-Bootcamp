# Standard I/O

To write command-line programs, you'll need to use the **standard streams**. Streams are abstractions provided by the operating system for sending data to and receiving data from a wide variety of devices.

Along with the code that does the specific calculations or computation needed for your program, you'll leverage the standard streams for input and output (I/O).

For the command-line programs you write early on, the standard input stream ("standard in") is the keyboard, and the standard output stream ("standard out") is the window of the terminal application which launched the program.

## Where does standard input fit in?

You can use `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()` to print a message to standard out, but how do you get information from standard in? The answer is to create a new `Scanner` using `System.in` and then use the `nextLine()` method.

Here is an example of using the two methods together to prompt the user to enter a value:

```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a value: ");  // prints out a message
String userInput = input.nextLine();  // saves what the user types in userInput
```

After the program runs these lines, `userInput` holds whatever the keyboard input the user typed before they pressed enter.
