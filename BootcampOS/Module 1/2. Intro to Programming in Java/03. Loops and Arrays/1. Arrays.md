# Arrays

**Arrays** are a special data type found in almost all programming languages. They make it more convenient to work with values in aggregate rather than a series of individual variables.

## Why are arrays useful?

You've already learned how to create variables and assign values to them. Using what you learned, your first inclination might be to write the following code to calculate the average test score for a group of students:

```java
int aaronScore = 80;
int beaScore = 98;
int billScore = 89;
int greerScore = 70;
int kyleScore = 93;
int margoScore = 84;
int peteScore = 66;
int zedScore = 96;
double averageScore = (aaronScore + beaScore + billScore + greerScore +
                    kyleScore + margoScore + peteScore + zedScore) / 8.0;
```

This works, but it's awkward for several reasons. First, there's a lot of typing. Second, it's difficult to keep everything straight. What if you forgot to include the scores for the two Sams in the class? You could add them to the code like this:

```java
int samScore = 85;
int samScore = 96;
.
.
.
double averageScore = (samScore + samScore + aaronScore + beaScore + billScore + greerScore +
                        kyleScore + margoScore + peteScore + zedScore) / 10.0;
```

However, the second `samScore` causes a "duplicate variable" compiler error. But you're a clever programmer and figure out another way: change the variable names.

```java
int student01 = 85;    // Sam
int student02 = 96;    // Sam
int student03 = 80;    // Aaron
int student04 = 98;    // Bea
int student05 = 89;    // Bill
int student06 = 70;    // Greer
int student07 = 93;    // Kyle
int student08 = 84;    // Margo
int student09 = 66;    // Pete
int student10 = 96;    // Zed
double averageScore = (student01 + student02 + student03 + student04 + student05 +
                    student06 + student07 + student08 + student09 + student10) / 10.0;
```

Then again, 10 students sounds like a small class. A more realistic size is probably 25 or more.

Changing the variable names doesn't address the issue of too much typing or lessen the potential confusion caused by so many variables. Adding 15 more students only exacerbates the problem. Additionally, it's a bad practice to use sequential numbering for naming variables.

Fortunately, there's an alternative: an array.

## Array basics

When you want to work with collections of values, you use arrays. Rather than creating multiple variables, you create a single variable name that can represent multiple values. Instead of worrying whether the test score is Bea's or Sam's (Sam 1 or Sam 2), you interact with the variable as a collection of scores.

### Declaring and initializing an array

Here's the syntax for declaring a new array:

```java
int[] testScores;
```

This command declares a new variable called `testScores`. Its data type is an array of integers.

Once you declare an array, you must initialize it:

```java
testScores = new int[10];
```

You've just initialized the array `testScores` to hold 10 integers.

There are three key points to know when working with arrays:

1.  Arrays represent sequential collections of items. There's a beginning and an end.
2.  All values in the array _must be the same data type_.
3.  The size of the array must be defined when initializing the array. Once created, the size is "fixed."

Often, you'll see programmers write those two lines on one statement:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];
```

Arrays aren't limited to integers. You can create arrays to hold any data type:

```java
String[] names = new String[5]; // an array of Strings
boolean[] switches = new boolean[10]; // an array of boolean values
```

If you know the values of your array, you can provide those values at the time of initialization:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[] { 85, 96, 80, 98, 89, 70, 93, 84, 66, 96 };
```

With this code, the compiler counts the number of items provided and uses that for the size of the array.

## Tip: How to initialize an array of unknown size

While you do need to define the size of the array when you initialize it, you don't need to _know the size_. As long as the size can fit inside of an integer, you can initialize an array using an integer variable:

```java
int someRandomNumber = 42;
int[] testScores = new int[someRandomNumber];

```

This code creates an array and uses the value `someRandomNumber` holds at the time of the array's initialization.

This is the first example of working with a reference type, and in it you're seeing the `new` keyword for the first time. You'll learn more about this, but for now, when you see the `new` keyword, know that it allocates memory to hold your data.

## Elements and indexes

Imagine that you have an array of integers called `testScores`. How do you talk about it?

![An array of test scores](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/576be949193cadfd438f150b31914da8.png)

First, it's important to know that each item inside of an array is called an **element**. The `testScores` array holds 10 elements.

When you want to reference a particular element in a discussion, you refer to it as "_the element at index X_." Notice that the first index starts at 0. In programming, counting often starts at 0, so the first element is at index 0.

## Note: Why zero?

Indexes start with zero because of the way arrays are stored in memory. Think of the variable `testScores` as a reference to a memory block where the array starts. Once you get to that memory block, index 0 means offset 0 blocks from the starting point. Index 1 means offset one block and so on.

Whenever you need to determine the last element in an array, you can use the calculation `length - 1`. Here, the length of the array is 10, so the last index is 9.

### Accessing elements within an array

To access a particular element in an array to read from or assign it to a new value, you can use **index notation**. Enclose the index of the element you're trying to access within a pair of `[]`:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];

testScores[0] = 85; // update the value at index 0 to 85
testScores[1] = 96; // update the value at index 1 to 96
testScores[2] = 80; // update the value at index 2 to 80
testScores[3] = 98; // ...
testScores[4] = 89;
testScores[5] = 70;
testScores[6] = 93;
testScores[7] = 84;
testScores[8] = 66;
testScores[9] = 96;
```

Retrieving a value from an element in the array works like reading the value of a variable, assuming you know the index.

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];

// ... populate array

int aaronsScore = testScores[0];
```

`aaronsScore` now holds a copy of the value stored at index 0 in the `testScores` array.

## Note: Out of range

Remember that arrays have fixed capacity. If you try to access an item which is beyond the range of the array, an error occurs that causes your program to stop.

## Determining the length of an array

Imagine that you wanted to get the last element in an array:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];

// ... populate the array

int lastValue = testScores[9];
```

You could do this since you know that 9 is the last index in the array. But what if someone changed the size of the array and made it smaller? Your code would trigger an exception because 9 is out of range.

Programmers strive to avoid hard-coding numeric values into their program. Fortunately, there's a formula that calculates the last index at runtime: `length - 1`. Most programming languages provide a way to access this value for a given array.

Each array has a property, `.length`, that allows you to retrieve the size of the given array:

```java
int size = testScores.length;
```

This syntax is often used when referencing the last value:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];

// ... populate the array

int lastValue = testScores[testScores.length - 1];
int secondToLastValue = testScores[testScores.length - 2];
```

Remember how expressions are evaluated? The `length - 1` expression evaluates first and evaluates to 9. That 9 is then used when the program runs to retrieve the actual last value from the array.
