# Loops

**Loops** are a fundamental concept for managing program control flow, but they go hand in hand with arrays. Loops provide a convenient way to write a small amount of code that can iterate through all of the values in an array one by one.

One of the things that's best learned with arrays is the concept of loops. Programs that you write can use any of the following control structures during execution:

1.  **A straight line/top-down** - the program runs from top to bottom and every line executes.
2.  **Applying conditional logic** - using `if/else`, the program conditionally executes code based on a condition being true.
3.  **Repetitive code flow** - the program continually executes a block of code as long as a condition remains true.

This lesson covers that last point—repetitive code flow.

There are three different types of loops used in programming:

-   **for loop** - used when you want code to repeat a defined number of times—for example, one time for each element in an array.
-   **while loop** - used when you want to continually execute a block of code as long as a condition remains true.
-   **do-while loop** - used when you want to execute a block of code _at least once_ and repeat it as long as a condition remains true.

The most common loop used is the for loop, though for many of the exercises you complete and perform on the job, any of the loop choices can be substituted.

## Writing a for loop

The for loop is defined using the following syntax:

```java
for (<initializer>; <condition>; <iterator>) {
    <body>
}
```

The loop consists of three important pieces:

-   _initializer_ - the statement (or set of statements) that sets the initial state. This is executed one time _before_ the loop begins.
-   _condition_ - before running the body of the loop, the expression is evaluated.
-   _iterator_ - a statement (or set of statements) that executes at the end of each pass through the loop.

The loop continues until the condition evaluates to false.

If you wanted to print "Hello World!" five times using a for loop, it would look like this:

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
```

Here's how the three parts match up:

-   _initializer_ - `int i = 1;` - declares a local loop variable called `i`. Its initial value is 1, and it's used to track which iteration of the loop you're on.
-   _condition_ - `i <= 5` - before running the body of the loop, checks to make sure `i` is less than or equal to 5.
-   _iterator_ - `i++` - after each iteration of the loop, increments the value of `i` by 1. This syntax is equivalent to `i = i + 1`. The condition is then evaluated again and if it remains true, the body executes.

## Tip: Increment and decrement operators

There are many different ways to increment a variable:

```java
i = i + 1;
i += 1;
i++;

```

There is a short-hand syntax for decrementing a variable as well:

```java
i = i - 1;
i -= 1;
i--;
```

## Looping through an array

If you wanted to create a for loop that iterates through your array of test scores, it might look like this:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];
// ... array is populated

for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
    int value = testScores[i];
}
```

Again, looking at the three parts of the loop:

-   _initializer_ - `int i = 0;` - `i` tracks which index of the array you're looking at. Since arrays start at index 0, so do you.
-   _condition_ - `i < testScores.length` - before running the body of the loop, checks to make sure `i` is less than the length of the array to avoid an out of range exception.
-   _iterator_ - `i++` - after you look at an element at `i`, you want to look at the next one, `i + 1`.

## Tip: Writing for loops

Make sure you practice writing a lot of for loops by hand. Most whiteboard problems involve for loops, and you'll find that writing code by hand is more challenging than typing it. It's best to prepare and be confident in writing some of the fundamental Java syntax.

### Calculating the average test score

Using the array of test scores, look at some code that can loop through the array and calculate the average. There are two steps to consider:

1.  Add up the sum of the scores within the array
2.  Divide the sum by the number of scores you're averaging

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10]; // the array

// ... array is populated

int sum = 0; // the sum of all the scores

for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + testScores[i];  // add each score to the sum
}

int average = sum / testScores.length;
```

In this case, you know how big the array is because you still see it. Realistically, you'll write this kind of code within methods where you didn't explicitly create the array.

```java
private int getAverage(int[] testScores) {

    int sum = 0; // the sum of all the scores

    for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
        sum = sum + testScores[i];  // add each score to the sum
    }

    int average = sum / testScores.length;

    return average;
}
```

### Scope

Notice you must declare the `sum` variable outside of the for loop. If you remember from the previous topic, once declared, variables are _in scope_. That variable remains in scope until the end of the block when it's discarded and goes _out of scope_.

Given that you want your `sum` variable to hold its value, you need to declare it before the loop. Any variable declared within the loop is reinitialized within each iteration of the loop.

## Breaking a loop

If at any point during the loop execution you need it to end without running the remaining iterations, use the `break` statement.

The following code looks through the array of test scores to see if it contains a perfect score:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];

// ... array is populated

boolean hasPerfectScore = false;

for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
    if (testScores[i] == 100) {
        hasPerfectScore = true;
        break;      // stop looking for a perfect score if you've found one
    }
}

System.out.println("Contains perfect score " + hasPerfectScore);
```

Unfortunately, there's no way to know if the array contains a perfect score. To be sure, you need to look at every single element in the array. If you find a perfect score before the end of the array, you'd want to stop looking. This is where `break` comes in.

If you don't break, you'd look through the remainder of the array when you don't need to. This is like looking for your keys in every room of your house after you've already found them.

## Skipping a loop

The other statement often used with loops is `continue`. When used inside a loop, the code within the loop body is skipped and continued to the next iteration.

Using the test score example, say you want to calculate the average and not include any zeroes:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[] { 100, 94, 0, 87, 88, 0};

int sum = 0;
int scoreCount = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
    if (testScores[i] == 0) {
        continue;  // don't count zeroes for average
    }
    sum += testScores[i];
    scoreCount++;
}

// sum equal to 369, scoreCount equal to 4
```

When this code is run, only the non-zero scores are counted and added up. The lines after `continue` aren't run when the loop gets to the two zeroes in the array.
