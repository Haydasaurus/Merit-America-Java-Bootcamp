# Catching multiple exceptions

A number of different exceptions could occur with your code. The syntax for a try-catch statement allows one or more `catch` blocks.

Doing this allows you to address each of the exceptions in different ways:

```java
try {
    // Perform some work, such as opening a file and reading all of the text.
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    // If the file doesn't exist, that exception is handled here.
} catch (IOException e) {
    // A general IO exception is handled here, such as being unable to read the file.
}
```

When the exception occurs from within the `try` block, it immediately stops and looks for the nearest `catch` block that matches the exception type. If you define the more generic exception instead of a specific exception first, you risk losing the ability to execute exception-specific code.

In sum:

-   It's best practice to catch a specific type of exception.
-   Place your catch blocks in order of most specific to least specific.
-   Avoid catching the base `Exception` class.
