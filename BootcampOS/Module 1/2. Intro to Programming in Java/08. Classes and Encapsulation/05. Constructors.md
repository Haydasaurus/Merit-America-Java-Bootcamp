# Constructors

When you define a class, you want to make sure it'll be instantiated into a usable, known state. That is, when the `new` statement creates a new object, you can assign any values the class needs so the object is ready for use. To do this, you use a constructor.

A **constructor** is a special method of a class that initializes an object of that class. Constructors have the same name as the class they're in, and because they always return an instance of that class, a return type isn't needed.

Below, the `Clock` class has a constructorâ€”`Clock()`. The constructor provides users the ability to set the clock to a specific time through the `hour`, `minute`, and `second` parameters when instantiated:

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    // Constructor has same name and spelling of class.
    // Notice there isn't a return type with constructors.
    public Clock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.second = second;
    }
}
```

```java
// Program.java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Creates a new clock initialized at 11:17:42
    Clock grandfather = new Clock(11, 17, 42);

    // Creates a new clock initialized at 16:11:01
    Clock watch = new Clock(16, 11, 1);
}
```
