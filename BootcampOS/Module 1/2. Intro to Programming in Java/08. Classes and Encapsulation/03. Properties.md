# Properties

Each class has unique characteristics. Continuing with the clock example, the `Clock` class represents the current hour, minute, and second. Properties add _state_ to the class. Each individual instance keeps track of its own separate state.

In Java, properties are also commonly called **instance variables**, or sometimes, **attributes**. This unit frequently uses _instance variable_ interchangeably with _property_ when discussing Java.

The following syntax adds properties to a class:

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    // Instance variables
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    //setters
    public void setHour(int hour) {
        this.hour = hour;
    }

    public void setMinute(int minute) {
        this.minute = minute;
    }

    public void setSecond(int second) {
        this.second = second;
    }

    //getters
    public int getHour() {
        return this.hour;
    }

    public int getMinute() {
        return this.minute;
    }

    public int getSecond() {
        return this.second;
    }
}
```

```java
// Program.java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    // Instantiate a new instance of a clock
    Clock grandfather = new Clock();

    // Set the time to 12:22:32
    grandfather.setHour(12);
    grandfather.setMinute(22);
    grandfather.setSecond(32);
}
```

## Tip: Follow Java coding conventions

In Java, all instance variables are accessed through methods called **Getters** and **Setters**. These are named based on the instance variable they're for with either the word `get` or `set` before them.

If the instance variable type is `boolean`, you use `is` instead of `get`, for example, `bool isDoorClosed()`.

When using Getters and Setters, keep the following in mind:

-   Getters and Setters follow the standard Java camel case naming convention.
-   Getters never have a parameter and always return the same data type as the instance variable that it's getting.
-   Setters always have a single parameter of the same data type as the instance variable being set and return `void`.

Methods, return data types, and parameters are explained later in the unit.

You defined three instance variables of type `int` named `hour`, `minute`, and `second`. This allows you to set them in your class, and they're saved throughout the lifetime of each instance.

The code sample also uses **public** and **private**. These are **access modifiers**. You'll learn more about them later.

## Note: About "this"

The `this` keyword is a special variable that refers to the current instance of an object.

Using this with a variable, such as `this.hour`, is a way to reference the hour property of this specific instance.

In the `setHour()` method, if you wrote `hour = hour`, it would be ambiguous which hour you were referring to. `this` differentiates the two.

## Derived properties

Sometimes, you want properties to represent an object's state, but its value is dependent on other properties. For example, you derive the full name of a person using a combination of first name and last name.

You can add a property that lets your clock return the current time, like "10:34:42." You don't need a fourth property with its own setter. Creating one might mean that the value it returns contradicts the value stored in the hour, minute, and second properties.

A derived property lets you generate the value by relying on the other properties within the class:

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    // Instance variables
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    // Derived Property, getter with no setter
    public String getCurrentTime() {
        return this.hour + ":" + this.minute + ":" + this.second;
    }

    public void setHour(int hour) {
        this.hour = hour;
    }

    public void setMinute(int minute) {
        this.minute = minute;
    }

    public void setSecond(int second) {
        this.second = second;
    }

    public int getHour() {
        return this.hour;
    }

    public int getMinute() {
        return this.minute;
    }

    public int getSecond() {
        return this.second;
    }
}
```

```java
// Program.java
public static void main(String[] args) {

    Clock grandfather = new Clock();

    // Set the time to 17:22:32
    grandfather.setHour(17);
    grandfather.setMinute(22);
    grandfather.setSecond(32);

    // Prints "Current time is 17:22:32
    System.out.println("Current time is " + grandfather.getCurrentTime());
}
```

> Note: You can have many derived properties as you want. The single derived property in the example code doesn't mean that classes are limited to a single derived property.

## Property defaults

Like variables, properties are automatically assigned default values depending upon their data type:

-   `0` or `0.0` for numeric types like `int` and `double`, respectively
-   `false` for `boolean`
-   `null` for `String` and other reference types

In most cases the default values are fine, however, there are times when you need to assign something other than the default.

For instance, the code in the previous section uses the derived property `getCurrentTime()`. It returns a string in _military_ time, `17:22:32`, instead of the _12-hour_ format most people expect, `5:22:32 PM`.

One way to fix the problem, while still allowing military time as an option, is to add a new `boolean twelveHourFormat` property. You can use it in `getCurrentTime()` to determine which format to return.

If `twelveHourFormat` is `false`, then `getCurrentTime()` returns military time. If `twelveHourFormat` is `true`, `getCurrentTime()` returns a 12-hour formatted string.

Since the default value of a `boolean` is `false`, `getCurrentTime()` always returns military time unless `twelveHourFormat` is set to `true`. The setter `setTwelveHourFormat(true)` can be called before getting the current time string to return a 12-hour formatted string.

But if the 12-hour format is usually preferred, it makes more sense to adjust the "default" value of `twelveHourFormat`. This way, you don't have to remember to call `setTwelveHourFormat(true)`.

To set a default value for a property, you need to assign the desired value in the declaration of the instance variable. In this case, you'd assign `true` to `twelveHourFormat`:

```
private boolean twelveHourFormat = true;
```

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    // Instance variables
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    // Set default value to true for twelveHourFormat
    private boolean twelveHourFormat = true;

    // Derived Property, getter with no setter
    public String getCurrentTime() {
        // Makes use of the twelveHourFormat property
        String currentTime = ":" + this.minute + ":" + this.second;
        if (this.twelveHourFormat) {
            if (this.hour > 12) {
                currentTime = (this.hour - 12) + currentTime + " pm";
            }
            else if (this.hour == 0) {
                currentTime = "12" + currentTime + " am";
            }
            else {
                currentTime = this.hour + currentTime + " am";
            }
        }
        else {
            currentTime = this.hour + currentTime;
        }
        return currentTime;
    }

    public void setHour(int hour) {
        this.hour = hour;
    }

    public void setMinute(int minute) {
        this.minute = minute;
    }

    public void setSecond(int second) {
        this.second = second;
    }

    public void setTwelveHourFormat(boolean twelveHourFormat) {
        this.twelveHourFormat = twelveHourFormat;
    }

    public int getHour() {
        return this.hour;
    }

    public int getMinute() {
        return this.minute;
    }

    public int getSecond() {
        return this.second;
    }

    public boolean isTwelveHourFormat() {
        return this.twelveHourFormat;
    }
}
```

```java
// Program.java
public static void main(String[] args) {

    Clock grandfather = new Clock();

    // Set the time to 17:22:32
    grandfather.setHour(17);
    grandfather.setMinute(22);
    grandfather.setSecond(32);
    // twelveHourFormat defaults to true

    // Prints "Current time is 5:22:32 pm
    System.out.println("Current time is " + grandfather.getCurrentTime());

    // Set the time to 20:36:15
    Clock humveeDashboard = new Clock();
    humveeDashboard.setHour(20);
    humveeDashboard.setMinute(36);
    humveeDashboard.setSecond(15);
    // Override twelveHourFormat default, and set to false
    humveeDashboard.setTwelveHourFormat(false);

    // Prints "Current time is 20:36:15
    System.out.println("Current time is " + humveeDashboard.getCurrentTime());
}
```
