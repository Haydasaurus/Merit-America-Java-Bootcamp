# Introduction

`List`s are _fast_ for reading data. You can retrieve any item in a `List` by its index. However, searching through a `List` is another matter. Imagine you have a `List` of animal names, and you need to find the "giraffe." Further imagine that the `List` has 5,000 items:

```java
// Assumes 'animalNames' list has already been created
for (String name : animalNames) {
    if (name.equalsIgnoreCase("giraffe")) {
        System.out.println("Found: " + name);
        break; // You may break out of foreach loops, just like for loops
    }
}
```

Because you don't know what index holds the item you seek, you may need to loop through the entire collection, which is very time consuming and resource intensive. Even worse, you might search through all 5,000 items only to find there's no giraffe.

There are alternatives to a brute-force linear search. For instance, keeping the names sorted alphabetically, and performing a _binary search_ can help minimize searches, but there is an even better way that avoids iterating through the `List` completely.
