# Unit summary

You've now learned about `List`s, `Map`s, `Stack`s, `Queue`s, and `Set`s. While these data structures are the ones used most often, there are many, many more.

You may want to explore these data structures further. Key ones to learn more about are:

-   **Linked-Lists** are a foundational data structure, and have many uses directly, or indirectly as part of a larger data structure.
-   **Trees** are often used to maintain a hierarchy of parent, children, and sibling relationships of data, like a file system.
-   **Graphs** show how two different pieces of data are connected. Graphs are often seen in social networking and path-finding/GPS algorithms.
