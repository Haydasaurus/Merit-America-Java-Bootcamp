# What's unit testing?

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual components, or units, of an application are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. In object-oriented languages such as Java, each method of a class can be considered a testable unit.

Unit tests are pieces of code that run and execute your code to make sure that it's doing what it's supposed to do. Because unit tests are themselves software, the testing process is automated, and becomes part of the full development cycle.

Think about building a car. Cars consist of hundreds of separate components, but for this example, limit them to ball bearings, brakes, and wheels. Your unit tests for the ball bearings might test that they can handle a billion rotations. Your unit tests for the brakes might test the vehicle's stability under breaking in slippery conditions, while those for wheels might evaluate the impact performance of a wheel. Each component of the car is tested.

In sum, unit tests have the following characteristics:

-   They're always automated.
-   They isolate each part of the program to show that individual parts are correct.
-   They help detect problems early.
-   They force developers to think through inputs, outputs, and error conditions.
