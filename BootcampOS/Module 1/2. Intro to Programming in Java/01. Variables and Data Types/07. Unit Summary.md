# Unit summary

In this unit, you learned about:

-   Some of the data types used to store program data in variables
-   How variables are declared and used in code
-   How arithmetic expressions are evaluated in code
-   How data can be converted from one type to another

## Tip: How to display values
When working with variables and expressions, you may want to see what value a certain variable or expression evaluates to. You can do that using `System.out.println()` like this:

```java
int num1 = 100;
int num2 = num1 * 2;
System.out.println(num2); // Displays "200" when the program runs
System.out.println((num2 * 2) + 1); // Displays "401" when the program runs

```

Don't worry if that seems a little mysterious right now. You'll learn more about `System.out.println()` in a future unit.
