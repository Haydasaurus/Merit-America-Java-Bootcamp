# Lists

The `List<T>` is the most common collection class used in the Java language. Like an array, a `List` serves as a general-purpose, type-safe collection of values.

Also, like an array, you access the values by a **zero-based** index. The primary difference between the two is that `List`s can grow and shrink in size, while arrays are always fixed in length.

Another important distinction for `List`s is they maintain the order in which items were added. The first item added is index 0, and the second is index 1.

When a data structure such as a `List` is said to be _ordered_, it's referring to the order in which items were added, and not to any alphabetical or other _sort_ order.

If you add "porcupine", "whale", "bat", and "monkey" to a list of animal names, the order of the list and the indexes of the values are:

> Note: the animal names aren't _sorted_ in any order except in which they were added.

## Creating new lists

Before you can create a list, you need to `import` the following Collections classes into your code:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

The syntax for creating a list is `List<T> identifier = new ArrayList<T>()`. So if you want a `List` of `String`s, you'd write:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
```

The `new` keyword sets aside memory to hold an instance of an `ArrayList`. The `ArrayList` constructor `()` is invoked to initialize the instance to an empty list of the type used, in this case a list of strings. Finally, the address of the new instance is assigned to the `names` variable.

### `List` versus `ArrayList`

Notice that the data type for the `names` variable is `List<String>` rather than `ArrayList<String>`. You can think of the `List` as a contract that itemizes all the operations which can be performed on any list, like adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting elements. The `ArrayList` is one class that fulfills the `List` contract.

This is called "programming to an interface", and it lets you write _polymorphic_, or interchangeable, code. You can find out more about the collections interfaces at [The Java Tutorials.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html)

## Note: Programming to an interface

For now, know that it's considered a Java best practice to create an instance of a class that fulfils the contract, and assign it to a variable which represents the contract. _This is common coding practice within Java, and particularly with all the Collections classes, not just lists._

### Data types

You aren't limited to creating `List`s of `String`s. You can create lists of any reference data type:

```java
List<LocalDate> dates = new ArrayList<LocalDate>();
List<Integer> amounts = new ArrayList<>();
List<Employee> employee = new ArrayList<Employee>();
List<Airplane> airplanes = new ArrayList<Airplane>();
List<VendingMachine> vendingMachines = new ArrayList<>();
```

The first two examples involve built-in Java data types. The remaining three create lists of user-defined data types: `Employee`, `Airplane`, and `VendingMachine`.

Note that `Integer` and `VendingMachine` data types aren't specified in the `ArrayList` on the right-hand side of the assignment in the sample code. The empty angle-brackets `<>` is called the "diamond operator", and is shorthand for saying, "Use the data type specified in the `List`."

## Note: What about primitives?

In Java, you can't put a primitive in any of the collection classes. It's a limitation of the language.

But the language's creators didn't want to leave out `int`s completely, so they made an object version of `int`s called `Integer`. In fact, they did that with all the primitive data types, including `Double`, `Character`, and `Boolean`.

These object versions are known as **Wrapper classes**. Wrappers automatically convert primitives to reference types and reference types to primitives. The conversion from primitive to object is called "**autoboxing**", while the reverse, from object to primitive, is known as "**unboxing**."

For more information, see [Autoboxing and Unboxing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html) .

## Adding new values

You use the `add()` method to add new values:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
names.add("Luke");
names.add("Leia");
names.add("Han");
```

You can also create `List`s and initialize them with values if you know them ahead of time:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
```

You can even create and initialize the `List`, and then add more values afterward:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
names.add("Chewbacca"); // names now contains Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca
```

`List`s also have another `add()` method that lets you add a value at a specific index in the array. Remember, the index is zero-based:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
names.add(0, "Chewbacca");   // names now contains Chewbacca, Luke, Leia, Han
```

Finally, like arrays, `List`s allow duplicate values:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
names.add("Leia");   // names now contains Luke, Leia, Han, Leia
```

## Removing values

There are two approaches to removing items from a `List`. The first uses the `remove()` method, passing the value you want to remove:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
names.remove("Luke");   // names now contains Leia, Han
```

If the value specified exists in the list more than once, `remove()` finds and removes only the first instance of the value:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han", "Leia"));
names.remove("Leia");   // names now contains Luke, Han, Leia
```

Alternatively, if you know the specific index of the item you want to remove, you could use the `remove()` method with the index:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
names.remove(1);   // names now contains Luke, Han
```

## Accessing list values

Now that you're working with objects and not arrays, you have to get values out of the `List` differently. You do that with the `get()` method:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));

// SPOILER ALERT! The secret children of Darth Vader: Luke and Leia
System.out.println(
    "SPOILER ALERT! The secret children of Darth Vader: " +
    names.get(0) + " and " + names.get(1)
);
```

### Iterating through the collection

Collections support a model of iteration called enumerators. **Enumerators** are a type that allow you to move forward through a collection, one item at a time. You can use a new loop called a **foreach loop** to do this. The syntax for the foreach loop looks like this:

```java
for(<type> <identifier> : <expression>) {
    <body>
}
```

To do this for your `List` of `String`s, you'd write the following:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
for(String name : names) {
    System.out.println("Character: " + name);
}
```

The name of the collection the foreach loop iterates over—in this example, the variable `names`—goes to the right of the `:`. As the loop iterates, it retrieves a value from the collection and needs a place to temporarily hold onto it. This is the purpose of the variable `String name` declared to the left of the `:`. The value from the collection is assigned to the variable which you can use inside the loop, as the code does in `"Character: " + name`.

## Tip: Using the foreach loop with arrays

You can use a foreach loop with arrays, too:

```java
String[] names = new String[] {"Luke", "Leia", "Han"};
for(String name : names) {
    System.out.println("Character: " + name);
}
```

You don't have to use a foreach loop. You can also use the regular for loop to move through the list. You'd typically use this approach if you need access to the current item's index:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
for(int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++) {
    System.out.println("Character at index " + i + ": " + names.get(i));
}
```

This code sample uses a new method called `size()` in the for loop. It returns the number of elements in the `List`. It's similar to the array `length`, but `size()` reflects the actual number elements in the collection, whereas `length` returns the fixed number of elements of the array.

## Note: `size()` method

All Collections classes have a `size()` method, which reflects the _current_ number of elements in the collection.

### for versus foreach loops

You may wonder when to use a for loop and when to use a foreach loop. In fact, you may even be asked that in an interview. Here's some points to consider regarding each:

**foreach**

-   Straightforward syntax
-   Only can move forward from the first item
-   Every item is retrieved
-   Unknown position in the collection—you don't have access to the index
-   Can't access neighboring items

**for**

-   Difficult syntax
-   Start and end where you want, and can go in reverse direction
-   Your choice to retrieve every item, every other item, every third item, etc.
-   Known position in the collection
-   Can access neighboring items or any item in the collection

## Other methods

This lesson covered some of the more common methods that `List`s contain, but it's important to know that there are many other methods that exist to make your job easier. Explore and experiment with the IntelliSense to see what other methods you can discover.
