# Logical branching

As a programmer, you may come across a situation where your program must decide what to do next based on the data available to it:

-   A healthcare portal might display different pages based on the age of the website visitor - think senior citizen versus young adult
-   If a user hasn't logged in, show them the login page; otherwise allow them to proceed
-   If a username is already taken, tell the user to select another username

This unit discusses concepts that enable code to make decisions and determine what to do next.
