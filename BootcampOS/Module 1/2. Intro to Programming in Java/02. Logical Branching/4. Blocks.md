# Blocks

Each of the sections of code that follow an `if` or an `else` statement are **blocks**. Blocks use a pair of braces **{..}** to enclose single or multiple lines of code, enhance code readability, and establish variable scope.

The following code is enclosed in a block that only executes when the condition is true. Note the indentation that occurs when you write code inside of a code block:

```java
if (condition) {
    // statement or block of code to run when condition is true
}
```

## Scope
In Java, you can declare a variable at any point in a block, but you _must_ declare it before you use it. Once declared, the variable is _in scope_. Variables are in scope until the end of the block when they're discarded and go _out of scope_.

## Nested blocks
Whether you have complex conditional logic or you're mixing multiple loops with conditions, blocks are often nested. Each nested block can declare and use its own set of local variables:

```java
{ // outer block
    int i;
    { // inner block
        int j;
    }
}
```

The variable `j` has the scope of the inner block. Statements within the inner block can use both `i` and `j`. Statements in the outer block can only use `i`. If you write the following code, a compilation error occurs because `j` is out of scope:

```java
{
    int i;
    {
        int j;
    }
    j = 33; // <--- not allowed, variable out of scope
}
```

You can't declare a variable in an inner block that has the same name as a variable in an outer block. This also creates a compilation error:

```java
{
    int i;
    {
        int i; // <-- not allowed, variable already in scope
    }
}
```
