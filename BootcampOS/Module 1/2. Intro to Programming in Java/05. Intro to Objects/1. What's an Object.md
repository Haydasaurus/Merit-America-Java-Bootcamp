# What's an object?

## Layers of abstraction
You've learned that when you write programs, you need to break your solutions down into step-by-step actions to solve problems. If you need to find the largest number in an array, you might write something like this:

```java
int largestElement = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < arrayOfNumbers.length; i++) {
    if (arrayOfNumbers[i] > largestElement) {
        largestElement = arrayOfNumbers[i];
    }
}
// largestElement will have the largest number from the array
```

You've looked at problems like this, as well as methods that let you encapsulate that code into something reusable:

```java
public int getLargestElement(int[] arrayOfNumbers) {
    int largestElement = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arrayOfNumbers.length; i++) {
        if (arrayOfNumbers[i] > largestElement) {
            largestElement = arrayOfNumbers[i];
        }
    }
    return largestElement;
}

int largestFromFirst = getLargestElement(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5});
// largestFromFirst == 5
int largestFromSecond = getLargestElement(new int[] {300, 240, 550, 129});
// largestFromSecond == 550
```

Grouping this code into a method makes it possible to reuse it rather than rewriting it. Being able to reuse methods helps to save time and helps you write more readable code.

It also means that you can work at a higher layer of abstraction. Putting the algorithm for finding the largest number inside of a method helps to solve more complex problems with less and more obvious code:

```java
public boolean isLargestElementEven(int[] arrayOfNumbers) {
    return getLargestElement(arrayOfNumbers) % 2 == 0;
}
```

The question that remains now is: if methods are good, are more methods better?

## Objects
**Object-Oriented Programming** is about organizing your problem-solving into objects. An **object** is an in-memory data structure that combines state and behavior into a usable and useful abstraction. In other words, objects are a collection of variables and methods.

Objects have many benefits:

1.  **They're modular**
    
    Breaking your programming into objects allows you to section off your code into pieces. You can treat each of these pieces as a mini-program that you can test and write separately from other parts of your application. This allows you to think about and plan each part of the whole.
    
2.  **They hide information**
    
    Most people frown upon hidden information, but in programming, it's a good thing. Objects are used by calling their methods, and other parts of the program that use the object don't know, or need to know, how the object's methods are actually coded.
    
    It doesn't matter how `getLargestNumber()` is implemented. What matters is that it produces the largest number. In fact, you might find a much faster algorithm that solves `getLargestNumber()` and can replace all the code in it whenever you want. As long as it takes an `int[]` and returns a `int`, you can change the code within that method all day long.
    
3.  **They allow you to reuse code**
    
    If you build your code using objects, reusing that code becomes straightforward—just create another object. Objects are built to be modular and handle one small function of your application, which makes them useful for many different purposes.
    
4.  **They're pluggable and testable**

    Because the objects are accessible through very defined methods, testing the object is a matter of calling those methods and making sure they're doing what you expect them to do. You can also swap out one object for another in your application. To do so, write another object that has the same method signatures. Then, you have a drop-in replacement for what was already there.
    

For these reasons and more, programming with objects, or object-oriented programming—is a smart idea when building a complex program in Java.

## What's a class?
So, how do you make an object? Technically, you don't write objects in your code. Objects only exist when your code is running because an object is an in-memory data structure. To make objects, you must write classes.

A **class** is a grouping of variables and methods in a source code file, from which objects can be created. It's important to know what a class is before you begin writing classes and using objects.

A class is to an object like a blueprint is to a house. A class defines the features of the objects created as instances of that class.

Imagine a blueprint that specifies the location of a bathtub. You can't take a shower in that tub because it's a drawing on a piece of paper. But if you build a house out of that blueprint, you can use the tub whenever you want.

In fact, you can build as many houses as you want from that blueprint, and each has its own shower. It's important that each house has its own bathtub and not share the same one between them.

The same is true for objects. Imagine that you have a class in your code that models a Person. This `Person` class has a variable to hold a first name and a last name.

```java
class Person {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;
}
```

That's your blueprint. You've created a class that defines two variables in it. But it's not an object just yet; it's a blueprint for one. To create an object from it, there are a few steps to complete.

## Creating objects
Creating a new object involves three pieces of code. They're usually, but not always, contained in the same statement.

1.  Declaration - A declaration associates a new variable name with a defined data type. You've seen this before when working with variables.
2.  Instantiation - Using `new` creates a new object in memory and returns the address to it. You've seen `new` with arrays before, and here it's doing the same thing—making a new object for you to use.
3.  Initialization - Using a constructor sets some initial values on the created object's instance variables. Essentially, it starts an object off with a certain state.

The following example shows these three pieces at work:

```java
                            // Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Siding
House houseAt443WinstonSt = new House(3, 2.5, "Cornflower Blue");
```

This line creates a new `House` object and stores a reference to that new in-memory object into the variable `houseAt443WinstonSt`. The following section summarizes each piece:

-   **Declaration**: `House houseAt443WinstonSt` is the declaration. It creates a variable called `houseAt443WinstonSt` that holds a reference to a `House` object. The data type of the `houseAt443WinstonSt` variable is `House`.
    
-   **Instantiation**: `new House()` is the instantiation. This creates a new _instance_ of a House in heap memory from the class `House` and then returns the address of that memory location to save it in a variable.
    
-   **Initialization**: `House(3, 2.5, "Cornflower Blue")` is the initialization. This starts the object off with some initial values in its instance variables. This creates the object, sets its values, and gets it ready for use right away.
    

These three pieces make up one common statement: the creation and initialization of a new object and storing a reference to it in a variable so it can be accessed.
