# Verifying installation

To confirm you have IntelliJ installed on your computer, and also practice opening, running, and testing a project, perform the following steps.

## Step 1: Open the HelloWorld project
1.  Launch IntelliJ IDEA and select **Open** from the Welcome Screen.
2.  Navigate to the `hello-world` project folder located in your student repository under `resources/intellij`. and select **Open**. You'll know you have the right folder if you see a `pom.xml` file.

Once opened, the `hello-world` project appears directly under the `Project` drop-down in the upper left-hand corner of the IDE.

## Step 2: Run the HelloWorld project
1.  Open `src/main/java/com.techelevator/HelloWorld`, right-click in the editor and select **Run 'HelloWorld.main()'** or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-F10`.
2.  You can also run the application by clicking on the green play button next to your `main()` method and selecting **Run 'HelloWorld.main()'**.

Running the project displays text similar to this in the lower left-hand **Run** window:
```
Hello!
Today is 2021-06-16
The current time is 11:04:11.288922800
```

The date and current time reflects the date and current time you run the project.

## Step 3: Test the HelloWorld project
1.  Open `src/test/java/com.techelevator/HelloWorldTests`, right-click in the editor and select **Run HelloWorldTests** or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-F10`.

When the tests run, the results are displayed in the lower left-hand **Run** window. You'll see four green checkmarks, one each to the left of `HelloWorldTests`, `twoPlusTwoEqualsFour`, `sevenDividedByTwoIsThree`, and `sevenDividedByTwoIsThreeAndOneHalf`.

If you have any trouble with opening, running, or testing, please review with your instructor.
