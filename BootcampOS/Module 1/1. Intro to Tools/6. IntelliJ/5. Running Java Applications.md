# Running Java applications

Now that you've created your project in IntelliJ, you can run it.

First, open the class that contains the `main()` method. To run your application, right-click in the editor and select Run or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-F10`.

You can also run the application by clicking on the green play button next to your `main()` method and selecting **Run**.

You can always rerun the application from the **Run** tool window by clicking the green play button or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-F5`.
