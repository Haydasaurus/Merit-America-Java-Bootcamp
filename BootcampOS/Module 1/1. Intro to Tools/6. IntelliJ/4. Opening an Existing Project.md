# Opening an existing project

Launch IntelliJ IDEA and select **Open** from the Welcome Screen to open any previously created project.

Navigate to the directory of the project (where the `pom.xml` file is located), and select **Open**.

Any projects that you recently opened appear in the main pane of the Welcome Screen. Clicking on a project opens it.
