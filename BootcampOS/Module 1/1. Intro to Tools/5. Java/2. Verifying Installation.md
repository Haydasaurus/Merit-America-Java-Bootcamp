# Verifying installation

To confirm you have Java 11 installed on your computer, run this command:
```shell
java --version
```

That outputs several lines of information like this:
```
openjdk 11.0.11 2021-04-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9 (build 11.0.11+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9 (build 11.0.11+9, mixed mode)
```

Look at the version number on the first line (in this example `11.0.11`). As long as the first number (the major version) is 11, you're all set.
