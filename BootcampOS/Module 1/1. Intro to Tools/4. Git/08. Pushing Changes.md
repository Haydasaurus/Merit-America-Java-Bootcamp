# Pushing changes

To copy changes that you make on your local repository to the remote repository, you use the `git push` command.

The `git push` command takes two arguments:

-   A remote name—`origin` is the default name automatically given to a remote repository when you clone it.
-   A branch name—for example, `main`.

The entire command may look like this:
```shell
> git push origin main
```

After you issue this command, you can go to your remote hosting service (Bitbucket, for example), and you'll see your changes there.
