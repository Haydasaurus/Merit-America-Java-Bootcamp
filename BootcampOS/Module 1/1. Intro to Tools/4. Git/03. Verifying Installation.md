# Verifying installation

## Verify Git installation
To verify that Git is installed, type the following command at your system terminal command prompt:

```
> git --version
```

If Git is installed, you'll see a response similar to this:

```
git version 2.30.0.windows.1
```

Don't worry too much about the version you see. Any Git version will work.

## Verify Git configuration
Git tracks changes made to program code so that any team member can see who made what change and when. To support this, you need to configure Git with a name and email address.

To check your username configuration, type this and press **Enter**:

```
> git config user.name
```

Likewise, to check your email configuration, type this:

```
> git config user.email
```

If you see your name and email in response to these commands, you've configured Git properly. If not, then you must type the following commands, replacing `<name>` with your name and `<email>` with your email:

```
> git config --global user.name <name>
> git config --global user.email <email>
```
