# Committing changes

When you're ready to store the staged changes into your local repository, you use the command `git commit`. This command records all staged files into the local repository. It creates a **_snapshot_** of what changed in each of the staged files from the previous version. This is like creating a save point in a video game so someone can go back to a previous version of the code as it existed at a point in time.

Use the `git commit` command with an argument `-m` to specify a **_commit message_**:
```shell
> git commit -m "Add iOS 14 support."
```

The commit message is important because it indicates what changed with this commit. It's also a permanent record in the repository, so make sure your commit message stays clean.

The `git commit` command adds an entry like the one below to the log. You can view commits with the `git log` command:
