# Relational databases

Unless you specifically arrange to persist data in your application, it's lost when the program ends. Simple text files work well for many small applications, especially if there is a limited amount of data, and it doesn't have to be well-organized.

Business-oriented programs such as an online bookstore, on the other hand, typically require a more robust solution than a text file. Not only is the amount of data much larger, it also needs to be better organized to separate customers from publishers or books from shopping carts.

Business applications usually store their data in some type of _database_. A database is an organized collection of data that allows for quick retrieval and updates. Good databases are fast, persistent, and consistent. The databases you'll look at here are **relational databases**.

A relational database is a certain type of database that acts like an Excel spreadsheet. A relational database consists of tables that contain columns where each column has a name and a data type. You can then insert rows into those tables where each row specifies the data for a certain element.

Most databases contain many tables that all relate to each other. You can store data in those tables and retrieve it again at a later time.

These databases are managed in **Relational Database Management Systems** (RDBMS). An RDBMS is a computer application that manages the definition, storage, retrieval, and administration of these databases.

These database systems are used for many reasons:

1.  They support storing a large number of records, often in the millions of records, quickly and efficiently.
2.  They enable central storage of all of a company's data.
3.  They support a structured query syntax to retrieve, insert, and update data.
4.  They enforce consistency and integrity of data so data won't get lost or corrupted.

You'll use relational databases for your applications, and the **Structured Query Language**, or SQL, to work with them.
