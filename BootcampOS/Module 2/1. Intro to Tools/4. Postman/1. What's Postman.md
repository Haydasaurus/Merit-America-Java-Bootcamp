# What's Postman?

Postman is a software tool that helps developers test Web APIs. An API, or **application programming interface**, is a way for different computer programs to transfer data between each other. A Web API is an API that's accessible over the internet.

If you've already read the unit on Web APIs, you'll know that they use URLs like websites, and that you can retrieve data from some APIs with a web browser. However, a browser isn't a good API testing tool because you can't do much more than simple `GET` requests, or requests that retrieve data. Interacting with an API often requires using different request methods—like `POST` and `PUT`—as well as sending data. Postman can do all of that and more.

Postman is an effective testing tool because it allows you to quickly create API requests, input request data, and read response data. If you're writing APIs, you can use Postman to test if your APIs are reacting correctly to requests. If you're writing software that interacts with an API, you can use Postman to analyze response data and troubleshoot your requests.
