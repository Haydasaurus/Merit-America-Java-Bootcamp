# Postman interface

Postman's interface can be a little overwhelming the first time you open it. This lesson helps you get acclimated to the interface and walks you through on how to create a request.

## Note: Account registration is optional

When running Postman for the first time, you'll see a screen prompting you to create a Postman account or sign in. An account allows you to back up your work and collaborate with others, but it's not required to use Postman. You can create an account at a later time if you wish. To skip creating an account for now, you can use the link at the bottom labelled **Skip and go to the app** to get started.

## Workspace view

Postman uses workspaces to group and organize related content. You can think of a workspace like a project you'd use in IntelliJ or Visual Studio.

If you're signed in, you can create multiple workspaces and share them with team members for collaboration. If you're not signed in, you get one workspace called the **Scratch Pad** that isn't synced or backed up online. This guide uses the Scratch Pad, but it's the same view you'd get in a workspace without access to some workspace-only components.

The sidebar on the left side of the window provides you access to the components that make up a workspace:

Until you start working on bigger projects, the two components you'll use most are the Collections and History components.

You can use Collections to save and group related requests together, making them easier to access and run. History shows you all the requests that you've run. Since you haven't made any requests yet, there's nothing to see, but you'll see how to save a request to a collection later.

You can minimize the left side of the window by going to the **View** menu and selecting **Toggle Sidebar**, or click the sidebar button in the lower left corner of the window:

## Creating a request

Interacting with Web APIs involves requests and responses. The client—in this case, Postman—makes a **request** to a server which provides the **response**. The server in these examples is a free one that generates fake data for testing purposes.

First, click the **Create a request** button under the "Get started" header on the right side of the window. You can also click the **+** button on the tab bar:

![Create request](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/820f4012a29201fc0138aa73566b6509.png)

In the new tab that appears, enter `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos` in the textbox that reads "Enter request URL" and click the **Send** button. You'll see the response returned in the lower section of the window:

![Request and response](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/1c5445744e22a65dffdb0940e20a9f35.png)

You just performed a `GET` request. The response from the server contains fake data that looks like a to-do list.

### Response status

When working with APIs, you'll have to work with response status codes that can tell you whether the response was a successful one or not. You can read more about status codes in the Networking and HTTP unit.

Postman displays the status code along with the response. This response is `200 OK` which is a successful response:

The time for the request to complete and the size of the response are displayed next to the status code. This information can help you diagnose slow requests in your application.

### Response headers

You can also view the response headers:

## Saving a request

Often you'll want to test an API more than once. Instead of changing the request URL and data every time, or keeping a lot of tabs open, you can save requests to come back to at a later time.

To save a request, click the **Save** button:

![Save request](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/565bd4f335b493cfe47d73315dbd358a.png)

In the window that appears, you can give the request a more meaningful name, like "GET all customers" or "POST new comment" depending on what your request is.

You can't save requests without being in collection, which is like a folder for related requests. Click the **Create a collection** button and give it a name like "Postman tests"—whatever seems like a good and meaningful name to you. After you type in the name, click the **Create** button. After you create or select a collection, you can click the **Save** button to save the request.

Once you save your request, you can see it in your Collections and reopen it at any time:

## History

You can use the History component to review and rerun any request:

If you want to save a request from the history view—say you closed the tab by accident or decide later that you want to save it—you can hover over any request and click the **+** sign to save it to a collection:
