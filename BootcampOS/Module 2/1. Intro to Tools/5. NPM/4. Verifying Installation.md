# Verifying installation

NPM is often installed along with the Node.js environment. You can verify NPM is installed by running this on the command-line:

```shell
npm --version
```

If you receive output that looks like `6.14.11`, that means NPM is installed.

The exact version number you receive may be different, but anything that starts with a `6` or higher is good.
