# What's a package?

When you write software, you don't need to write everything from scratch. The language or framework that you use provides many capabilities. For example, you don't need to convert a string into an array to get a substring or the character at a particular index. You use built-in functions that do that for you.

You can also import other code into your projects that offers more features, like file I/O or a web server. Sometimes this other code comes with the language, and you only need to import the library or namespace into your code.

There are other times you need to download an external library or module to get other capabilities. Typically these libraries are available as **packages**.

A package is a type of file archive that contains code or executables and associated information like the package name, version number, and dependencies necessary for it to run properly. Dependencies are often other packages available from the same source.

Packages are installed and managed by a **package manager**. A package manager is a set of tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, and configuring, and removing packages in a consistent manner.

Package managers work with a **package repository** or **package registry**, which is a central storage location for packages. Package repositories may contain packages for a particular programming language, IDE, or an entire operating system.
