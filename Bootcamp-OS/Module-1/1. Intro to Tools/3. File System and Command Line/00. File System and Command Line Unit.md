# Introduction

Successful programming requires more than just understanding and writing code; it requires the ability to work with files. In its broadest sense, software development unites code with data. Programmers store code along with data and other resources such as configurations, pictures, and sounds in files.

You may already be familiar with the built-in file manager that comes with your operating system. The Windows file manager is File Explorer, and the one for macOS is Finder.

However, you might not be as familiar with using the **command line** to navigate folders and files. Many developers use the command line to perform tasks like navigating a file system, utilizing tools, and running scripts.

In this unit, you'll learn how file systems work and how to interact with them in a command line.

# File system

A **file system** is the way a computer stores files and folders.

All operating systemsâ€”like Windows, macOS, and Linuxâ€”have file systems. They're an important component in any operating system, and while they may differ from each other in implementation and capabilities, they all share the same basic concept of organizing the raw data recorded on a storage medium into files and folders.

## Files
Files are the basic building blocks of any file system. In general, most users understand that documents, spreadsheets, pictures, and songs are all files, even if they don't always think of them as such.

Files have names and various attributes such as the date and time they were created, a size, and permissions limiting who can access them. You can copy, move, rename, and even delete files.

Filenames also usually contain an **extension**. An extension is typically three or four characters, but can be more, that follow the `.` in a filename. You may already be familiar with some popular extensions like `pdf`, `mp3`, and `jpg`. The filename extension is often used to declare the type of file, and associate that file with a program that opens it by default.

## Folders
Folders, also called directories, are for holding and organizing files. In fact, a file can't exist outside of a folder. All files reside in some folder.

In addition to files, folders may contain other folders, sometimes also called subfolders. The subfolders may hold other files and folders. This is what gives the file system a hierarchical structure.

Like files, folders have names and many of the same attributes as folders. You can copy, move, rename, and delete folders too.

## Special folders
There are many special folders present in all modern file systems. In addition to the built-in folders such as Desktop, Downloads, and Pictures, there are two key folders you'll work with as a programmer.

### Home folder
The home folder is the folder associated with a user's login name where the special folders like Desktop and Downloads reside. Most files and folders a user works with are located here, or in a subfolder of the home folder.

### Root folder
The root folder is the absolute beginning of any file system. It's the base folder that holds all other files and folders.

In macOS and Linux, the root is referred to as `/` and contains files and folders from the hard drive or other storage media.

Under Windows, the root is associated with a drive-letter such as `C:\` or `D:\`. Unlike macOS and Linux, there isn't necessarily a single root in the Windows file system. Other hard drives and storage media get their own drive-letters.

## Paths
A **path** represents the location of a file or folder, including the folders it's contained in. You can think of a path like a set of driving directions to a location like your friend's house. You follow turns into specific folders until you arrive at your destination.

Here are some examples of what a path can look like:
-   `/Users/alice/Documents`
-   `Pictures/vacations/Vegas.jpg`
-   `resources/book.txt`

Directory paths can also end in a `/` like `/Users/alice/Documents/`. That's equivalent to the example in the preceding list.

### Path separator
The file system for Windows uses the backslash (`\`) to separate directories. macOS, Linux, and other Unix-like operating systems use the forward-slash (`/`).

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Using forward-slash paths on Windows**
There are tools for Windows that give you a Unix-like command line that uses the forward-slash separator. You'll use one of these tools in this course, so most paths you'll see in this course use the forward-slash pattern.

You'll learn more about this in the next lesson.

### Path types
There are two types of file paths: absolute and relative.

An **absolute** path starts at the root `/` of your file system, for example `/Users/alice/Documents` or `/temp/install-log.txt`.

A **relative** path starts from another location and only contains the part you need to get from there to the file or folder. Using your home directory as a starting point, such examples might be `Documents/receipts` or `Pictures/vacations/Eiffel-Tower.jpg`.

>**âœ” Tip: The difference between absolute and relative paths**
>
>Using the analogy of driving directions to your friend's house again, you can think of the two types of paths like such:
>
>- **_Absolute path_** is directions that you can follow from anywhere: "Take the interstate to exit 23, turn right, go 7 miles..."
>-   **_Relative path_** is directions your friend gives you when you call from the gas station across town: "Make a right out of the parking lot, go 2 miles..."
>
>They both get you to the same location, but the directions were different.

### Path aliases
There are some shortcuts you can take when typing a path. These aliases help you save time rather than manually typing out paths to get around the file system:

-   `~` refers to your home directory. Your home directory absolute path could vary based on the operating system, but `~` always refers to your home directory.
    -   For example, `~/Documents/receipts` might refer to `/Users/alice/Documents/receipts`.
-   `..` is an alias that means "up" one directory, sometimes referred to as the _parent_ directory. This is often used in a relative path, to go up one level from the current location.
    -   For example, if you were in `~/Documents/taxes`, then `../receipts` gets you to `~/Documents/receipts`.
    -   You can chain multiple `..` together to go up as many directories as necessary. If you were in `~/Documents/taxes/2021`, then `../../receipts` gets you to `~/Documents/receipts`.

# Command line

The term **command line** refers to any text-based computer interface. Nearly all operating systems have a **command-line interface** or CLI, whether it's apparent to users or not.

The command line can be a powerful tool. Developers and other computer professionals tend to prefer the command line because of its flexibility. While each command typically performs a single function, you can combine commands to perform complex tasks. There are also many applications that developers use that are only available as a command-line application.

Other synonymous terms for the command line include command prompt, terminal, console, or shell.

## Accessing the CLI
Each operating system comes with its own command-line interface. Many use the same basic commands, but they're not necessarily compatible with each other.

This course assumes you're running **Bash**. Bash is a popular command line that's available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Windows
Bash doesn't come preinstalled on Windows. However, there are many tools such as "Git Bash" and "Windows Terminal" that give you a Bash shell. This is different than the "Command Prompt" and "PowerShell" applications that come preinstalled on Windows.

### macOS
Bash comes preinstalled on macOS, but it isn't the default shell on recent versions. When you open the "Terminal" application, you can type `bash` to get a Bash prompt. If you don't want to type that every time, you can type `chsh -s /bin/bash` to set Bash as your default shell.

### Linux
Bash may be preinstalled on Linux depending on your installed version. You can follow the same directions for macOS to run Bash and change your default shell.

## Anatomy of a command
Before you learn about important Bash commands, you need to understand what makes up a command.

The most basic command is a single wordâ€”that's a string of characters without a space and not necessarily an English word. This word typically runs a program or performs some built-in task.

### Parameters
Some commands can use additional information to perform a task called a **parameter**, or sometimes called an **argument**.

Parameters may be optional or required depending on the command and the parameter. A space separates commands and parameters, and separates multiple parameters. Parameters always come after commands, and the order can matter depending on the command.

Examples of commands with parameters look like this:
```shell
command parameter
command parameter1 parameter2
```

### Options
Some commands can have their behavior altered through **options**, sometimes called **flags** or **switches**. You can use options to do something different than the normal behavior, like displaying information in a specific format.

Options are separated from parameters and commands by a space and also have to come after the command. Options are prefixed by a `-` or `--`. Single dash (`-`) options are typically one character, while double dash (`--`) options can sometimes be written out. Single dash options can sometimes be combined with the same dash.

Examples of commands with options and parameters:
```shell
command -o
command -o parameter
command --output parameter
command -o -v
command -ov
command --output --verbose
```

In the next lesson, you'll learn about specific Bash commands that you can use to navigate a file system.

# Bash commands

Now you'll learn about some important Bash commands you can use to navigate the file system and work with the files and folders on your hard drive.

## Navigating the file system
Navigating around the system requires knowledge of three commands: `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`.

### Change directories
When you're working in the command line, you're always in a directory somewhere. This is your **_working directory_**. You can change the working directory with the `cd` command:
```shell
cd /Users/alice/Documents
```

This command directs the computer to go to the root folder, `/`, then into the `Users` folder, then the `alice` folder inside of that and finally, the `Documents` folder in that. This style of using `cd` is using an **_absolute path_**. An absolute path always starts at the beginning of the file systemâ€”at the rootâ€”and then specifies each path to take from there.

If you run the previous command, you enter the `/Users/alice/Documents` folder. What if you want to go to the `/Users/alice` folder from there?

You could type out the full path again, like this:
```shell
cd /Users/alice
```

You could also use a **_relative_** path. If you're already in `/Users/alice/Documents`, you can go up one directory by typing this:
```shell
cd ..
```

The `..` isn't a directoryâ€”it has a special meaning. When used as a path, it means "go up one level from here" or to the parent directory. In this case, if you run `cd ..` from inside `/Users/alice/Documents`, you change directories to `/Users/alice`.

If you're in `/Users/alice/Documents` and you type this:
```shell
cd ../..
```

This sends you to `/Users`. In other words, it sends you to your parent's parent.

There's another special character you can use in a path. The `~` character always means your home folder. Regardless of what folder you're in, you can type this to always change to your home folder:
```shell
cd ~
```

You can also use the `~` as part of a path. If your home directory is `/Users/alice`, then you can type this to go to `/Users/alice/Documents`:
```shell
cd ~/Documents
```

Now, you know how to get somewhere, but how do you know where you are?

### Print working directory
You can find out what folder you're in at any time by using the `pwd` command:
```shell
pwd

/Users/alice
```

The `pwd` command tells you where you are as an absolute path. But how do you find out what's here?

### List directory contents
To find out what's in the current folder, use the command `ls`:
```shell
ls

content/  node_modules/  package.json  package-lock.json  README.md  robots.txt  styles/
```

`ls` lists out all of the folders and files that are in the current folder. This helps you navigate easier and make sure that you have what you're looking for. Bash shows folders with a trailing `/` to distinguish them from files in the list.

The `ls` command accepts an optional argument giving the path to list. In the preceding example, to list the contents of the `styles` subdirectory, you can use the relative path of the folder to list:
```shell
ls styles
```

If you want more details on those files and folders, you can pass some command line [options](https://lms.techelevator.com/cohorts/42/blocks/5/content_files/command-line/03-command-line.md#options) to `ls`, like this:
```shell
ls -al

total 744
drwxr-xr-x 1 alice 197121      0 Jun 14 09:00 ./
drwxr-xr-x 1 alice 197121      0 Jun 10 11:18 ../
drwxr-xr-x 1 alice 197121      0 Jun 14 12:12 .git/
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice 197121   1027 May  8 18:08 .gitignore
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice 197121    390 Jun 14 09:00 .vale.ini
drwxr-xr-x 1 alice 197121      0 Jun 14 09:00 content/
drwxr-xr-x 1 alice 197121      0 Jun 14 10:25 node_modules/
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice 197121    519 Jun 14 09:00 package.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice 197121 441974 Jun 14 09:00 package-lock.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice 197121    499 May 10 13:49 README.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice 197121     28 May  8 18:08 robots.txt
drwxr-xr-x 1 alice 197121      0 Jun 14 09:00 styles/
```

Using the two flags `-al`, which stands for `all` and `long`, provides more details on the children of this folder. It also shows hidden files, or files that start with a period (`.`).

## Working with files and folders
When you want to work with the files and folders on your computers, there are some useful commands that you'll need to know.

### Moving files and folders
To move a file or a folder to a different place, use the `mv` command. It requires two [parameters](https://lms.techelevator.com/cohorts/42/blocks/5/content_files/command-line/03-command-line.md#parameters). The first parameter is the file or folder you want to move, and the second parameter is where to move it to.

For example, if you wanted to move a file called `readme.txt` from your home folder to your `Documents` folder, you could do it like this:
```shell
mv /Users/alice/readme.txt /Users/alice/Documents/
```

Alternatively, you could use the `~` to mean your home directory:
```shell
mv ~/readme.txt ~/Documents/
```

This command is also how you rename things. If you wanted to rename `readme.txt` to `info.txt`, you could do that like this:
```shell
mv readme.txt info.txt
```

### Copying files and folders
You can also copy files and folders, putting a duplicate in another location without getting rid of the original.

To copy a file, use the `cp` command:
```shell
cp readme.txt info.txt
```

After this runs, you still have your original `readme.txt`, but you have a new file called `info.txt` with the same content.

To copy a folder, you need to add a `-r` option to the command:
```shell
cp -r Documents Documents_backup
```

The `r` stands for recursive, meaning it duplicates the `Documents` folder _and all of its contents_, so be careful running it on a folder with a lot of content.

### Making folders
You can also make an empty folder at any time with the `mkdir` command:
```shell
mkdir my_stuff
```

This creates a new directory called `my_stuff` at your current location.

### Removing files and folders
>**ðŸ›ˆ Warning: Take caution when removing files and folders**
>
>Unlike deleting a file in Windows and macOS, where it sends the file to the "Recycle Bin" or "Trash", these commands remove the file or folder permanently with no ability to undo your action.

You can remove files with the `rm` command:
```shell
rm info.txt
```

You can remove **empty** directories with the `rmdir` command:
```shell
rmdir my_stuff
```

However, you can't delete a folder that still has files in it.

## Additional shell commands
See ![Bash File System Commands](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_System_Utilities) to learn more about additional shell commands.

# Quiz

**File system and command line 1**

Which Bash command displays the path of the current working directory?

**Answer:** pwd

**Explanation:** `pwd` stands for **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory.

---
**File system and command line 2**

What prints in response to the final command?

```shell
$ pwd
/c/Users/fred/taxes/2021/federal

$ cd ../..

$ pwd
```

**Answer:** /c/Users/fred/taxes

**Explanation:** Starting from `/c/Users/fred/taxes/2021/federal`, the `cd` command moves "up" two folders, and `pwd` prints the current working directory.

---

**File system and command line 3**

Which commands list the contents of the current working directory?

	Select all correct options

â–¡ `pwd`

â–  `ls`

â–¡ `pwd .`

â–¡ `ls ..`

â–¡ `pwd -al`

â–  `ls .`

**Explanation:** `ls` lists the contents of a folder. The `.` says list the current folder, but that parameter is not necessary. With no parameter, Bash lists the current folder.

---

**File system and command line 4**

Which of the following shell commands changes the working directory to your home directory regardless of your current working directory?

â—‹ `cd home`

â—‹ `cd ..`

â—‹ `cd /`

â—‰ `cd ~`

â—‹ `cd.`

**Explanation:** `~` is a shortcut that represents the user's home directory.

---

**File system and command line 5**

Which of the following are absolute paths?

	Select all correct options

â–¡ documents

â–  /data/documents

â–¡ ../expenses

â–  ~/Documents

â–¡ .

**Explanation:** An absolute path leads you to the same location regardless of your current working directory. Both of these paths satisfy that requirement.

---

**File system and command line 6**

You execute the following commands and get these results:

```shell
$ pwd
/c/Users/alexia/Documents/taxes/2021/federal

$ ls -al
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 1 MMorel 197121     0 Nov 17 12:58 ./
drwxr-xr-x 1 MMorel 197121     0 Nov 17 11:46 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 MMorel 197121 15997 Nov 17 13:00 1040.txt
```

You need to delete the `federal` folder from `2021`. Put the following commands in the proper sequence:

â–¤ `rm 1040.txt`

â–¤ `cd ..`

â–¤ `rmdir federal/`

**Explanation:** You must remove all files from the folder before you delete it. Also, you can't remove a folder you are currently in (your working directory).
