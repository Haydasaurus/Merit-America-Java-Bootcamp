# What's version control?

Whether you work individually or on a team, protecting the source code for a software project is important. **Version control** is software often used to help track the changes over time to a codebase. Version control systems are a category of software tools that help teams manage changes to source code over time. They offer three major benefits:
1.  Teams can **_go back in time_** when a bug occurs and compare different versions of the source code.
2.  Version control simplifies sharing changes between team members, which guarantees that everyone has the latest copy.
3.  Team members can develop code in parallel through the use of branches and merge them together when complete.

Watch the following video to learn how version control can benefit any type of collaborative team.

# Introduction to Git

## Git
One of the most widely used version control systems in the world today is Git. You can find it at the core of most open source projects and in many different organizations. Almost all Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), the software that developers use to write and test their code, offer built-in integration with Git.

> **_Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Developers primarily use Git for source code management in software development. You can also use it to keep track of changes in any set of files._**
> 
> â€” _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)_

Git is software that you install and run on your development computer. Once you start using Git on your computer, all of the changes you make to your code are tracked and saved in a local database, or **repository**.

Using Git to track and save versions of your code on your computer is great, but it still poses some issues. If your hard drive crashes, you could lose all of your data. And if you're working on a project with other developers, Git alone offers no way to share your code with the team.

## GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab
GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab are a few services known as **remote repository hosts**. These websites store your Git data in the cloud so it's safe and backed up, and it can be shared across a team.

You transfer data from your local computer to the remote hostâ€”for example, GitHubâ€”by **_pushing your changes_** to it. You can download new code from a remote repository, like code that a teammate wrote, by **_pulling the changes_** onto your computer.

Together, Git and a remote hosting service provide everything a team needs to safely manage its code.

# Verifying installation

## Verify Git installation
To verify that Git is installed, type the following command at your system terminal command prompt:
```shell
> git --version
```

If Git is installed, you'll see a response similar to this:
```
git version 2.30.0.windows.1
```

Don't worry too much about the version you see. Any Git version will work.

## Verify Git configuration
Git tracks changes made to program code so that any team member can see who made what change and when. To support this, you need to configure Git with a name and email address.

To check your username configuration, type this and press **Enter**:
```shell
> git config user.name
```

Likewise, to check your email configuration, type this:
```shell
> git config user.email
```

If you see your name and email in response to these commands, you've configured Git properly. If not, then you must type the following commands, replacing `<name>` with your name and `<email>` with your email:
```shell
> git config --global user.name <name>
> git config --global user.email <email>
```

# Using Git

## The Git workflow
Working with Git requires you to follow a special workflow. It starts with copying the code to your machine. You then proceed to make changes locally, stage and commit those changes, and when ready, push to preserve them. For most developers, the cycle of change, stage, commit, and push occurs at least once on a daily basis.

It's broken down into the following steps:
![Git Workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/163681697-b9d1a0e7-ff95-4c32-bdcf-9f2d1a5947fe.png)

1.  Prepare your machine to edit the code, typically by cloning a remote repository to a local repository on your machine.
2.  Make edits to the local files and folders. This includes adding new, moving, deleting and renaming existing files and folders. Git calls the entire set of files and folders the **_working tree_**, but to you it's just your local folders and files. All of which means that Git is **_tool agnostic_**. Git doesn't care what tool or tools you used to manipulate the files and folders, changes are changes, and Git can handle them all.
3.  Once you're satisfied with a set of changes, **_stage_** the modified files and folders. Git places the changes into a special place it calls the **_index tree_** or the **_staging index_**. The staging index reflects all the changes to include in the next commit. You may stage multiple times before committing.
4.  Once you've staged all the changes and you know you want to keep them, **_commit_** the staged changes, providing a clear message indicating the purpose of the modifications. Git places these commits into its **_commit tree_**. Developers refer to this as "committing the changes to the repository."
5.  Now you can **_push_** your changes. This sends all of the commits that you made locally to the remote repository from which you cloned your local repository.

# Creating a repository

To begin working with an existing repository, a developer needs the remote URL so they can clone the repository to the computer as a local repository. A remote URL is Git's way of identifying "a place where code is stored."

This URL may reference a location on GitHub, Bitbucket, or another server. On GitHub, it's usually found on the home screen of the repository and in the format of `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git`. The URL always ends with `.git`.

With this URL, you run the command `git clone` from the command line to download a copy of the repository:
```shell
git clone <remote-url>
```

Once you _clone_ a remote repository, you have the entire codebase and are free to begin making changes.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Warning: Clone location**
>
>When you use the `git clone` command, git automatically creates a folder for you in the location of your current working directory. Be careful not to perform this command inside of an existing git repository.

---

# Staging changes

Git has three main states that a file can exist in:
1.  **Modified** - the file has been changed but not marked to save to your local repository yet
2.  **Staged** - the file is marked in its current version to go into your local repository in the next commit
3.  **Committed** - the data is safely stored in your local repository

The `git status` command checks the status of all modified and staged files within the repository. As a developer, it becomes second nature to use the `git status` command to continually see which files have been staged or modified.

## Stage explicit files
You can use the `git add` command to stage a modified file:
```shell
> git add <file-name> [<file-name> ...]
```

This version of the `git add` command supports explicit file names to stage. You can stage multiple files at the same time by separating the names with spaces. The command `git add foo.txt bar.txt` stages two files: `foo.txt` and `bar.txt`.

## Stage explicit directory
This version allows you to specify a directory to have its contents staged:
```shell
> git add <directory-name> [<directory-name> ...]
```

Git detects which files inside the directory have been recently modified.

## Stage all changes beneath current location
This version allows you to stage the contents of **_this directory and all directories beneath it_**:
```shell
> git add .
```

It can save time over the other more tedious `git add` commands.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Warning: Be careful with `git add .`**
It's important to know what your current working directory is before running this command. If you aren't located in the root of the repository, you may only stage some of the changes. If you're located in the root and run this command, then you'll stage every addition, modification, and deletion to modified files in the repository.

## Stage all changes
```shell
> git add -A
```

This stages **_all_** changes you have made anywhere within this repository, regardless of your current working directory. In many cases, you want to include all of the work that you have done since the last commit into the next commit.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Argument case**
The case of the arguments matters to Git. In the previous example, `-A` must be uppercase for Git to recognize it.

---

# Committing changes

When you're ready to store the staged changes into your local repository, you use the command `git commit`. This command records all staged files into the local repository. It creates a **_snapshot_** of what changed in each of the staged files from the previous version. This is like creating a save point in a video game so someone can go back to a previous version of the code as it existed at a point in time.

Use the `git commit` command with an argument `-m` to specify a **_commit message_**:
```shell
> git commit -m "Add iOS 14 support."
```

The commit message is important because it indicates what changed with this commit. It's also a permanent record in the repository, so make sure your commit message stays clean.

The `git commit` command adds an entry like the one below to the log. You can view commits with the `git log` command:
```
commit 1787389986db4df29c916f14f297f51dda86208f
Author: Tim Cook <tim@apple.com>
Date:   Thu Aug 16 22:31:51 2020 -0500

    Add iOS 14 support.
```

# Pushing changes

To copy changes that you make on your local repository to the remote repository, you use the `git push` command.

The `git push` command takes two arguments:

-   A remote nameâ€”`origin` is the default name automatically given to a remote repository when you clone it.
-   A branch nameâ€”for example, `main`.

The entire command may look like this:
```shell
> git push origin main
```

After you issue this command, you can go to your remote hosting service (Bitbucket, for example), and you'll see your changes there.

---

# Pulling changes

Whether you're working on separate computers (one at home, one at work) or with different team members, you'll need a way to incorporate the changes that are in the remote repository into your local repository. The `git pull` command instructs git to fetch commits from a remote repository.

The `git pull` command looks like this:
```shell
> git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

>**âœ” Tip: Pull before you push**
>
>You can't push your changes to a remote repository if the remote repository has changes that you haven't incorporated into yours yet. When you are one of a team of developers, always do `git pull` before `git push`.

The workflow diagram shown earlier therefore changes a bit in a team environment:
