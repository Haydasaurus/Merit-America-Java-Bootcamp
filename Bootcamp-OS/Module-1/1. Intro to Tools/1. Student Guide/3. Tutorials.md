# Tutorials

As a software developer, you'll often learn new concepts and technologies from tutorials. Most units in Bootcamp OS include tutorials providing you an opportunity for hands-on coding practice. Each tutorial presents a problem and walks you through solving it with code, step by step.

Tutorials aren't exhaustive. A tutorial's goal is to provide a basic example, helping you apply what you learned so that you can understand its use.

## Working through the tutorials
Every tutorial includes a `README.md` file explaining what you'll accomplish, along with instructions for working through the code. This file also tells you how to open the code and any other steps you need to take to get started.

Some tutorials include existing code. When this is the case, the instructions contain explanations for any existing code so you can understand how everything works together.

Each tutorial also includes the completed solution that you can refer to if you get stuck.

## How to access tutorials
Your course instructor will place these tutorials in your student repository in Git. You'll learn about repositories and how to access them in the Intro to Tools: Git unit.
