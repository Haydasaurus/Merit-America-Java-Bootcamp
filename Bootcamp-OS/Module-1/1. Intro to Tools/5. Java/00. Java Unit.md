# Intro to Java

## What is Java?
Java is a computer programming language. It was developed at Sun Microsystems and first released in 1995. Sun Microsystems was later acquired by Oracle, the company that currently owns Java.

You may have heard of another programming language with a similar name: JavaScript. JavaScript was named after Java, but the two languages aren't related from a technical perspective.

Java's syntax is similar to earlier programming languages like C and C++. Unlike those languages, however, which were designed to be compiled and run on specific computer hardware, Java was designed to be compiled and run on a **virtual machine**. This means Java programs are more readily deployed on a wide variety of platforms and is part of the reason why Java has been so widely adopted in enterprise settings.

## Source code and bytecode
When you write a Java program, the code you write is referred to as **source code** and is stored in a file named with the ".java" extension. Before you can run the program, you must compile that source code into **bytecode**. The bytecode file has the same name as the source code file, but it has the ".class" extension. Bytecode is highly optimized and is intended for processing by the virtual machine, rather than being read or edited by programmers.

The following diagram depicts the relationship between Java source code, bytecode, and the platforms on which Java programs run.

## JVM and JDK
Two acronyms you should be familiar with are:
-   **JVM** - A JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a program that runs Java bytecode.
-   **JDK** - A JDK (Java Development Kit) is a collection of software that includes a JVM along with other development tools and standard libraries.

## Java versions
Oracle continues to release updated versions of Java. Since Java is open source, other organizations are also free to create and distribute their own versions. Which version of Java an organization chooses to use depends on many factors, including cost, performance, and availability of support. Java 8 and 11 are currently the most popular versions of Java in enterprise settings.\

# Verifying installation

To confirm you have Java 11 installed on your computer, run this command:
```shell
java --version
```

That outputs several lines of information like this:
```
openjdk 11.0.11 2021-04-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9 (build 11.0.11+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK-11.0.11+9 (build 11.0.11+9, mixed mode)
```

Look at the version number on the first line (in this example `11.0.11`). As long as the first number (the major version) is 11, you're all set.
