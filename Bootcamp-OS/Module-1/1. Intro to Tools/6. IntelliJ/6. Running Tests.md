# Running tests

If you want to run all the tests in a test class, you can right-click on the file and select **Run**.

This brings up the **Run** tool window and displays the results. If any of the tests fail, use the link "Click to see difference" to find out why the tests failed.

If there's more than one test class, you can run all of them by right-clicking on the `src/test/java` folder and selecting **Run 'All Tests'**.
