# Integrated development environment (IDE)

In the early days, programmers wrote applications on punch cards. One line of code, one punch card. The cards were stacked horizontally in cardboard trays. Keeping the cards unbent and in order was extremely important.

When the application was ready, the tray was carried to the jobs desk where the application would be scheduled, and eventually run. The turnaround time between submitting a job and getting results could be anywhere from minutes to days, depending upon the availability of the computer and the priority of the application. It was a slow and tedious process.

Thankfully, programming has changed since then. Over time, programmers have been able to leverage improvements in hardware and software to make their work easier and more manageable. Text editors were developed so programmers could write the code on screens and not on punch cards. Early languages like Basic and Pascal were given programming environments with built-in capabilities tailored for each language.

Additionally, as programming transformed from programmers working alone and into broader team efforts, tools to share and communicate were created. Eventually, all these things were brought together into a single tool called an **integrated development environment** (IDE).

In general, IDEs share several common features.

## Projects
All of the resources of an application, including its source code, tests, libraries, and other types of files like sounds and images are gathered into a folder on the local hard drive known as the project folder, or **project** for short.

There's other information related to a project that's tracked by the IDE, such as the language version, build settings, and links to external resources. The IDE maintains this information in the **project settings**.

The IDE displays resources in a tree structure with the project as the root of the tree. You navigate between the various resources the same way you do in the Windows File Explorer. When you click on a specific resource, the contents of the resource are displayed in an editor or viewer depending upon its type.

Basic copy, move, addition, and deletion of resources is typically available. Changes to the contents of resources, copies, moves, additions, and deletions of the resources are tracked as changes to the project and recorded in a version control system if one is present.

## Language-specific enhancements
Perhaps one of the most appreciated features of an IDE is the assistance when working with source code.

### Syntax highlighting
**Syntax highlighting** displays text in different colors and fonts to help programmers quickly identify and understand the various parts of code. In addition to making code more readable, syntax highlighting is often used to point out the location of errors. Some examples include a misspelled keyword or a mismatched pair like an opening parenthesis without a closing parenthesis.

### Intelligent code completion
Intelligent code completion, often called **IntelliSense**, is a language-aware code completion feature. It provides suggested bits of code that can either be ignored or accepted by the programmer as they type. IntelliSense can help to increase programmer productivity while significantly reducing typos and other common mistakes.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: IntelliSense**
>
>Technically, "IntelliSense" is Microsoft's version of intelligent code completion included in Visual Studio (an IDE) and other Microsoft products.

In addition to these features, many IDEs offer a number of extras such as debugging tools to track down and fix problems, refactoring tools to improve code quality, connection management to services such databases, and profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.

# Creating a new Java project

Launch IntelliJ IDEA. When the Welcome screen opens, click **New Project**.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What if the welcome screen doesn't appear?**
>
>If a previous project opens rather than the Welcome screen, go to the main menu and select **File > New**.

From the list on the left, select **Maven**. Make sure the box labeled "Create from archetype" is _not_ checked, and click **Next**.

Finally, you'll need to fill in some basic properties for the project:
-   **Project name**: Specify the project name.
-   **Project location**: Specify the path to the directory in which you want to create the project. By default, the IDE creates a directory with the same name as the project.

Click **Finish** to create and open your project.

---

# Opening an existing project

Launch IntelliJ IDEA and select **Open** from the Welcome Screen to open any previously created project.

Navigate to the directory of the project (where the `pom.xml` file is located), and select **Open**.

Any projects that you recently opened appear in the main pane of the Welcome Screen. Clicking on a project opens it.

---

# Running Java applications

Now that you've created your project in IntelliJ, you can run it.

First, open the class that contains the `main()` method. To run your application, right-click in the editor and select Run or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-F10`.

You can also run the application by clicking on the green play button next to your `main()` method and selecting **Run**.

You can always rerun the application from the **Run** tool window by clicking the green play button or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-F5`.

---

# Running tests

If you want to run all the tests in a test class, you can right-click on the file and select **Run**.

This brings up the **Run** tool window and displays the results. If any of the tests fail, use the link "Click to see difference" to find out why the tests failed.

If there's more than one test class, you can run all of them by right-clicking on the `src/test/java` folder and selecting **Run 'All Tests'**.

---

# Verifying installation

To confirm you have IntelliJ installed on your computer, and also practice opening, running, and testing a project, perform the following steps.

## Step 1: Open the HelloWorld project
1.  Launch IntelliJ IDEA and select **Open** from the Welcome Screen.
2.  Navigate to the `hello-world` project folder located in your student repository under `resources/intellij`. and select **Open**. You'll know you have the right folder if you see a `pom.xml` file.

Once opened, the `hello-world` project appears directly under the `Project` drop-down in the upper left-hand corner of the IDE.

## Step 2: Run the HelloWorld project
1.  Open `src/main/java/com.techelevator/HelloWorld`, right-click in the editor and select **Run 'HelloWorld.main()'** or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-F10`.
2.  You can also run the application by clicking on the green play button next to your `main()` method and selecting **Run 'HelloWorld.main()'**.

Running the project displays text similar to this in the lower left-hand **Run** window:
```
Hello!
Today is 2021-06-16
The current time is 11:04:11.288922800
```

The date and current time reflects the date and current time you run the project.

## Step 3: Test the HelloWorld project
1.  Open `src/test/java/com.techelevator/HelloWorldTests`, right-click in the editor and select **Run HelloWorldTests** or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-F10`.

When the tests run, the results are displayed in the lower left-hand **Run** window. You'll see four green checkmarks, one each to the left of `HelloWorldTests`, `twoPlusTwoEqualsFour`, `sevenDividedByTwoIsThree`, and `sevenDividedByTwoIsThreeAndOneHalf`.

If you have any trouble with opening, running, or testing, please review with your instructor.
