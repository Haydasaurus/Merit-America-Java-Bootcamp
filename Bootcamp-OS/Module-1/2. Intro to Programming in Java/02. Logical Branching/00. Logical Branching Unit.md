# Logical branching

As a programmer, you may come across a situation where your program must decide what to do next based on the data available to it:

-   A healthcare portal might display different pages based on the age of the website visitor - think senior citizen versus young adult
-   If a user hasn't logged in, show them the login page; otherwise allow them to proceed
-   If a username is already taken, tell the user to select another username

This unit discusses concepts that enable code to make decisions and determine what to do next.

# Boolean expressions

In the previous unit, you learned an expression always evaluates to a single value. Outside of arithmetic expressions, another common expression is a **boolean expression**. This expression always evaluates to `true` or `false`.

There are two common ways that boolean expressions are built:

-   Comparison operators (to compare two values)
-   Logical operators (to create relationships between one or more boolean values)

## Comparison operators
As programmers, when you create applications, you often need to use basic arithmetic comparisons to allow your website visitors to make a choice or present them with different options. For example, you may want to:

-   Calculate if a number is odd or even to create alternating row colors in web pages
-   Validate that there are enough tickets available before allowing a user to reserve a seat for an event
-   Check to see if the user hasn't been to the site within 90 days to show them a reminder

The following comparison operators allow you to make these comparisons.

| Operator | Meaning                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `==`       | Equal To                 |
| `!=`       | Not Equal To             |
| `>`        | Greater Than             |
| `<`        | Less Than                |
| `>=`       | Greater Than or Equal To |
| `<=`       | Less Than or Equal To    |

When used in an expression, these comparison operators always evaluate to a boolean `true` or `false` value. For example:

```java
int number = 5;

boolean isItFive = (number == 5);      // true if number is '5'
boolean isItEven = (number % 2) == 0;  // true if number is evenly divisible by '2'
boolean isItNegative = (number < 0);   // true if number is less than but not equal to 0
```

## Logical operators
The comparison operators are limited in their ability to compare values between two different types. When a boolean expression needs to take two or more considerations into account to evaluate a boolean valueâ€”for example, is the number negative AND is it evenâ€”then the logical operators are used.

The logical operators are AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), XOR (`^`), and NOT (`!`). These operators work with one or more boolean operands to evaluate a boolean expression and yield `true` or `false.`

### NOT `!`
When placed in front of a boolean value, the logical not operator negates the value of the boolean operand.

### AND `&&`
If both of the operands on each side of the `&&` are `true`, the result of the expression is `true`. If one of them is `false`, the result is `false`. Consider the variable called `width` used in the following expression:

```java
(width >= 0.5) && (width <= 5.0)
```

This expression is true if the `width` is between 0.5 and 5.0.

### OR `||`
If either of the operands on each side of the `||` are `true`, then the result of the expression is also `true`. The expression is only `false` when both operands are `false`. For example, consider the variable called `width` used in the following expression:

```java
width < 0.5 || width > 5.0
```

This expression is true if the `width` is less than 0.5 or greater than 5.0.

### XOR `^`
This operator is called exclusive-or. If one operand in the expression is `true` and the other operand is `false`, then the result of the expression is `true`. In an exclusive-or, whenever both operands have the same value, the expression is `false`.

This expression isn't used as often as the logical AND and logical OR.

### Logical operator table
The following table sums up the different logical operators:

| `A`     | `B`     | `!A`    | `A && B` | `A ï½œï½œ B` | `A ^ B` |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| **TRUE**  | **TRUE**  | FALSE | TRUE   | TRUE     | FALSE |
| **TRUE**  | **FALSE** | FALSE | FALSE  | TRUE     | TRUE  |
| **FALSE** | **TRUE**  | TRUE  | FALSE  | TRUE     | TRUE  |
| **FALSE** | **FALSE** | TRUE  | FALSE  | FALSE    | FALSE |

Using one of the previous examples, if you wanted to find out if a number was negative AND even, you could write it like this:

```java
int number = 5;

boolean isItEven = (number % 2 == 0);      // true if number is even
boolean isItNegative = (number < 0);       // true if number is less than but not equal to 0

boolean answer = isItEven && isItNegative; // true if isItEven is true and isItNegative is true
```

## Reading complex expressions
In programming, you may encounter many different combinations of comparison and logical operators used in an expression. Boolean expressions can be combined.

Assume two integers, `a` and `b`, are used in the following expression:

```java
int a, b;
boolean output = (a >= 10 && a <= 20) || (b >= 10 && b <= 20);
```

In the previous expression, `output` is only true if `a` or `b` is between 10 and 20. What if you give `a` the value of 8 and `b` the value of 13? Below, you can see how the expression is simplified step-by-step.

First, the values for the variables are replaced within the expressions.

```java
boolean output = (8 >= 10 && 8 <= 20) || (13 >= 10 && 13 <= 20);
```

Next, the following comparison operations are evaluated, simplifying the expression:

-   `8 >= 10` is `false`
-   `8 <= 20` is `true`
-   `13 >= 10` is `true`
-   `13 <= 20` is `true`

```java
boolean output = (false && true) || (true && true);
```

After the comparison operations, the logical expressions are evaluated:

-   `false && true` yields `false`
-   `true && true` yields `true`.

```java
boolean output = (false) || (true);
```

Lastly, `false || true` is evaluated, and the final value is `true`. The complex expression from a few steps back is simplified into:

```java
boolean output = true;
```

# Conditional code

There are many different choices available to programmers who want their code to take various paths based on a `true` or `false` condition.

The most common approach developers use to allow their code to take various paths is `if`, `if/else`, or `if/else if/else`.

With each of the following examples, any usage of the word `condition` can be replaced by a boolean variable or a more complex boolean expression evaluated from comparison and logical operators.

## Single conditions with `if`
The format for an `if` condition follows:

```java
if (condition) {
    statement or block performed if condition is true
}
```

## Two paths with `if/else`
The format for an `if/else` condition follows:

```java
if (condition) {
    statement or block performed if condition is true
} else {
    statement or block performed if condition is not true
}
```

>**ðŸ›ˆ Warning: Don't add conditions for else**
>
>Notice that there's no condition after the else keyword. You don't need to add a condition because `else` always executes if the condition in the `if` section is `false`.

## Multiple paths using `if/else if/else`
If you need to provide more than two paths for the code to take, you can use an `if/else if` code branch. With the `if/else if`, each time you write `if`, you need to supply an additional condition that indicates if the following code block should run.

Once Java runs into the first true condition, it executes the following block of code. After that block, the program resumes after the last conditional block:

```java
if (condition) {
    statement or block you do if the first condition is true
} else if (other condition) {
    statement or block you do if the first condition is false
    and the second condition is true
} else if (other condition 2) {
    statement or block you do if the first two conditions are false
    and the third condition is true
} else {
    statement or block you do if all the above conditions are false
}
```

> **âœ” Tip: Else not required**
>
>The `else` isn't required. It's only useful if you want a default option if all the conditions before it are `false`.

When chaining multiple `if/else if` blocks, make sure to put your most exclusive option first. Programs stop at the first condition they find to be true. If there are less exclusive options first, then there is a risk that the code block you thought would run does not. Consider the classic FizzBuzz problem which has programmers return 'Fizz' if a number is divisible by 3, 'Buzz' if the number is divisible by 5, and 'FizzBuzz' if the number is divisible by 3 and 5.

```java
int n = 15;

if (n % 5 == 0) {
  // Fizz
} else if (n % 3 == 0) {
  // Buzz
} else if (n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0) {
  // FizzBuzz
}
```

The program never finds FizzBuzz. As soon as `15 % 5 == 0` is evaluated and true, the remaining conditions are never evaluated and the result is Fizz.

## Choosing between two values
There's another conditional operator that acts like an if statement but is used to select between two different values. This operator is called a **Ternary Operator**. It looks like this:

```java
conditional ? true_value : false_value
```

This may look odd at first, but this `if` shorthand is helpful when formatting data to print to a user.

The way the ternary operator works is that first the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the operator returns the value after the `?`, but if it's false, it returns the value after the `:`. You won't use this often, but it's useful in these situations:

```java
int numOfBananas = ...;
String message = "We have " + numOfBananas + " banana" + (numOfBananas != 1 ? "s" : "");
```

This puts an "s" on "banana" if there's more than one banana.

# Blocks

Each of the sections of code that follow an `if` or an `else` statement are **blocks**. Blocks use a pair of braces **{..}** to enclose single or multiple lines of code, enhance code readability, and establish variable scope.

The following code is enclosed in a block that only executes when the condition is true. Note the indentation that occurs when you write code inside of a code block:

```java
if (condition) {
    // statement or block of code to run when condition is true
}
```

## Scope
In Java, you can declare a variable at any point in a block, but you **_must_** declare it before you use it. Once declared, the variable is **_in scope_**. Variables are in scope until the end of the block when they're discarded and go **_out of scope_**.

## Nested blocks
Whether you have complex conditional logic or you're mixing multiple loops with conditions, blocks are often nested. Each nested block can declare and use its own set of local variables:

```java
{ // outer block
    int i;
    { // inner block
        int j;
    }
}
```

The variable `j` has the scope of the inner block. Statements within the inner block can use both `i` and `j`. Statements in the outer block can only use `i`. If you write the following code, a compilation error occurs because `j` is out of scope:

```java
{
    int i;
    {
        int j;
    }
    j = 33; // <--- not allowed, variable out of scope
}
```

You can't declare a variable in an inner block that has the same name as a variable in an outer block. This also creates a compilation error:

```java
{
    int i;
    {
        int i; // <-- not allowed, variable already in scope
    }
}
```

# Methods

In programming, methods break programs up into small, repeatable units of code. They allow programmers to create blocks of code that perform a single action or calculation where the answer only changes based on the inputs provided to it. Later units explore this further.

For now, it's important that you begin to read and understand three components of a method declaration:

-   The return type
-   The method name
-   The parameter list

![Method Declaration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/163690563-a136f690-7878-4c24-bbb9-692164ad7595.png)

## Return type
A method returns to the code that invoked it when it completes all the statements in the method, reaches a return statement, or runs into an error, also called an **exception**, whichever occurs first.

You specify a method's return type in the method declaration. Within the body of the method, the return statement returns a value of that type.

You'll see this later, but any method declared `void` doesn't return a value. It doesn't need to contain a return statement, but it can have one so the method ends early, as shown here:

```java
return;
```

If you try to return a value from a method that's declared `void`, you get a compiler error.

Any method that isn't declared `void` must contain a return statement with a corresponding return value, like this:

```java
return returnValue;
```

The data type of `returnValue` must match the data type specified in the method declaration.

## Method name
The method name is a clear name indicating what type of action or calculation the method performs when invoked. It's important that you write method names that clearly indicate to other programmers what the method does.

In Java, method names are camel case.

## Parameter list
Parameters act like variables. They have a data type, a name, and their value can be obtained by using it in a code statement or expression. When you create a method, parameter lists indicate what inputs are required for the method to run.

When writing method bodies, you don't necessarily know the values of the parameters like you do with variables. This is challenging because you have to think of the parameters as their data type without knowing their specific value. Consider the following method:

```java
public int multiplyBy(int multiplicand, int multiplier) {
    int result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

This method indicates that it accepts two parameters and returns an integer. The first parameter acts as the multiplicand and the second, the multiplier.

As you'll see later, you invoke these methods by calling their name and passing in parameters.

```java
int output = multiplyBy(3, 4);  // invokes MultiplyBy method. 3 is the multiplicand, 4 is multiplier
// ...
// ...
output = multiplyBy(9, 2);      // invokes MultiplyBy method. 9 is the multiplicand, 2 is multiplier
```

Each time a program calls the `multiplyBy()` method, it **_passes_** values for the multiplicand and the multiplier. The `multiplyBy()` method uses those values to calculate a new result.

# Quiz

## **Logical Branching 1**

```java
long x = 10;
long y = x - 4;
boolean answer = y >= 6;
```

**Does `answer` evaluate to true or false?**

â—‰ true

â—‹ false

**Explanation:** The variable `y` is assigned the value of `x - 4` or `10 - 4`, which is `6`. `6` is greater than or equal to `6`.


## **Logical Branching 2**

```java
int x = 7;
int y = x % 2;
boolean answer = y >= 3;
```

**Does `answer` evaluate to true or false?**

â—‹ true

â—‰ false

**Explanation:** The variable `y` is assigned the value of `x % 2` or `7 % 2`, which is `1`. `1` isn't greater than or equal to `3`.


## **Logical Branching 3**

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
boolean answer = !(x > y);
```

**Does `answer` evaluate to true or false?**

â—‰ true

â—‹ false

**Explanation:** `10` isn't greater than `20`, so `x > y` evaluates to `false`. The `!` outside the parenthesis negates the value inside, so `answer` becomes `true`.


## **Logical Branching 4**

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 8;
int z = 15;

boolean answer = (x > y) || (z % x == 0);
```

**Does `answer` evaluate to true or false?**

â—‰ true

â—‹ false

**Explanation:** The `x > y` expression evaluates to `false` because `5` isn't greater than `8`. The `z % x == 0` expression evaluates to `true` because `z % x` is equal to `0`. The `||` is a logical OR which evaluates two expressions and is `true` if either side is equal to `true`.


## **Logical Branching 5**

```java
int sum = 14;

if (sum < 20) {
   System.out.println("Under");
}
else {
   System.out.println("Over");
}

System.out.println("the limit");
```

**What does this code display?**

â—‹ Under

â—‹ Over

â—‰ Under the limit

â—‹ Under Over the limit

â—‹ the limit

**Explanation:** "Under" prints because `14` is less than `20`. The `else` block doesn't run because the `if` condition is `true`. "the limit" prints regardless of the if/else before it.


## **Logical Branching 6**

```java
boolean p = true;
boolean q = false;

if (p && q) {
     System.out.println("Apple");
} else {
     System.out.println("Orange");
}
```

**What does this code display?**

â—‹ Apple

â—‰ Orange

**Explanation:** The expression `p && q` evaluates to `false` because the `&&` is a logical AND which evaluates two expressions and is `true` only if both sides are equal to `true`. `q` is `false`, so the expression is `false`. Because the condition of the `if` statement is `false`, the `else` block runs.


## **Logical Branching 7**

```java
boolean p = true;
boolean q = true;

if (!p || !q) {
     System.out.println("Apple");
} else if (p ^ q) {
     System.out.println("Orange");
} else {
     System.out.println("Banana");
}
```

**What does this code display?**

â—‹ Apple

â—‹ Orange

â—‰ Banana

**Explanation:** The expression `!p || !q` evaluates to `false` because the `||` is a logical OR which evaluates two expressions and is `true` if either side is equal to `true`. `p` and `q` are `true`, but the `!` negates each, so the expression evaluates as `false || false`, which is `false`. The expression `p ^ q` is also `false`, because the `^` is a logical XOR, or exclusive-or, which evaluates two expressions and is `true` if only one side is `true` and the other is `false`. Because both `p` and `q` are `true`, the expression evaluates as `false`. Because neither `!p || !q` or `p ^ q` is `true`, the `else` block runs.


## **Logical Branching 8**

```java
int x = 6;
int y = -2;

if (y < 0) {
    // Is the x variable accessible here?
}
```

**Is the `x` variable accessible at the location of the comment?**

â—‰ Yes

â—‹ No

**Explanation:** The `x` variable is accessible inside the `if` block because it's declared outside of it.


## **Logical Branching 9**

```java
int x = 6;
int y = -2;

if (y < 0) {
    int z = x * y;
}

// Is the y variable accessible here?
```

**Is the `y` variable accessible at the location of the comment?**

â—‰ Yes

â—‹ No

**Explanation:** The `y` variable is accessible after the `if` block because it's the same scope as where it's declared.


## **Logical Branching 10**

```java
int x = 6;
int y = -2;

if (y < 0) {
    int z = x * y;
}

// Is the z variable accessible here?
```

**Is the `z` variable accessible at the location of the comment?**

â—‹ Yes

â—‰ No

**Explanation:** The `z` variable isn't accessible outside the `if` block because variables are only in scope inside the block where they're declared.
