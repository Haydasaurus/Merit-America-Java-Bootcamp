# Polymorphism and inheritance

Recall that in the last unit, you added subclasses that inherit from the `Clock` class:

```java
public class Clock {
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    public void setTime(int hour, int minute) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.second = 0;
    }

    /* ... */
}

public class GrandfatherClock extends Clock {
    /* ... Grandfather Clock implementation */
}

public class CuckooClock extends Clock {
    /* ... Cuckoo Clock implementation */
}

public class AlarmClock extends Clock {
    /* ... Alarm Clock implementation */
}


```

Suppose you needed to create a `Shopkeeper` class whose responsibility is to reset all of the different clocks to 7 AM:

```java
public class Shopkeeper {

    public void setTime(GrandfatherClock clock) {
        clock.setTime(07, 00); // Set a grandfather clock to 7 o'clock
    }

    public void setTime(CuckooClock clock) {
        clock.setTime(07, 00); // Set a cuckoo clock to 7 o'clock
    }

    public void setTime(AlarmClock clock) {
        clock.setTime(07, 00); // Set an alarm clock to 7 o'clock
    }
}
```

Do you notice a _code smell_ here? You're adding a method for every type of `Clock`. Your code is _tightly coupled_. When you want to add a new `Clock` type, you have to add a new `setTime()` method for it as well.

**Polymorphic code** allows you to take advantage of the fact that your different clock classesâ€”`AlarmClock`, `GrandfatherClock`, and `CuckooClock`â€”have an **_is-a_** relationship with a `Clock`.

Given that `AlarmClock`, `GrandfatherClock`, and `CuckooClock` are subclasses of `Clock`, you can write a single function that accepts a reference to a `Clock` while allowing any class that inherits from it too:

```java
public class Shopkeeper {

    public void setTime(Clock clock) {
        clock.setTime(07, 00);    // Set any clock to 7 o'clock
    }
}
```

Now you've written **_loosely coupled code_**. The `Shopkeeper` doesn't differentiate between the different clocks when it comes to setting time. Think about itâ€”how many times have you said "go reset that cuckoo clock to 7 o'clock?" Realistically, you're likely to point at the cuckoo clock and say "go reset that clock to 7 o'clock."

The `Shopkeeper` class is now only dependent on `Clock`. If you add a new class that inherits from `Clock`, like a `Watch`, the code in your `Shopkeeper` class has no reason to change:

```java
public class Watch extends Clock {
    /* ... Watch implementation */
}
```
