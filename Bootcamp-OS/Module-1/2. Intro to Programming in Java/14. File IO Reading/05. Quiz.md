## **File I/O Reading 1**

**Which of the following classes represents a file path and can be used to check whether the path exists, if it's a file or directory, get directory contents, and other file system operations?**

◉ `java.io.File`

○ `java.io.FileInputStream`

○ `java.io.FileReader`

○ `java.io.FileWriter`

**Explanation:** `File` is a representation of file and directory pathnames.


## v**File I/O Reading 2**

**`FileNotFoundException` extends `IOException` which extends `Exception` which extends `Throwable`. The `getMessage()` method of `Throwable` can be called on a `FileNotFoundException` object. This is an example of what OOP principle?**

○ Encapsulation

◉ Inheritance

○ Polymorphism

○ Cohesion

**Explanation:** A subclass can "inherit" methods from its superclasses.


## **File I/O Reading 3**

**What does the following code do?**

```java
File dataFile = new File("myFile.txt");
```

○ Creates a new text file called "myFile.txt" on the user's disk

○ Opens the file "myFile.txt" from disk for reading into the program

◉ Creates a Java `File` object which references the path "myFile.txt"

○ Checks whether the file "myFile.txt" exists on the user's disk

**Explanation:** This statement creates a Java object and assigns it to the variable `dataFile`. It doesn't do anything in the file system.


## **File I/O Reading 4**

**What does the `hasNextLine()` method of a `Scanner` return if there are no more lines to be read from the file?**

◉ `false`

○ `0`

○ `null`

○ `""` (empty string)

○ `true`

**Explanation:** `hasNextLine()` returns a boolean value: `true` if there are more lines, `false` if not.


## **File I/O Reading 5**

**What does the following code do?**

```java
File dataFile = new File("myFile.txt");
Scanner dataInput = new Scanner(dataFile);
while (dataInput.hasNextLine()) {
    String lineOfInput = dataInput.nextLine();
    System.out.println(lineOfInput);
}
```

	Select all correct options

■ Opens a file called "myFile.txt" from disk

□ Creates the file "myFile.txt" if it doesn't exist

□ Tells the user if the file "myFile.txt" doesn't exist

■ Reads all lines from the file

■ Prints each line to the user's terminal window

□ Closes and unlocks the file

**Explanation:** This code opens a file (if it's there), reads in each line, and writes each line to `stdout`.


## **File I/O Reading 6**

**What does the following code do?**

```java
File dataFile = new File("myFile.txt");
try (Scanner dataInput = new Scanner(dataFile)) {
    while(dataInput.hasNextLine()) {
        String lineOfInput = dataInput.nextLine();
        System.out.println(lineOfInput);
    }
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    System.err.println("The file does not exist.");
}
```

	Select all correct options

■ Opens a file called "myFile.txt" from disk

□ Creates the file "myFile.txt" if it doesn't exist

■ Tells the user if the file "myFile.txt" doesn't exist

■ Reads all lines from the file

■ Prints each line to the user's terminal window

■ Closes and unlocks the file

**Explanation:** This code opens a file if it's there, informs the user if it's not there, reads in each line, writes each line to `stdout`, and then closes the file to free the file system resource.


## **File I/O Reading 7**

**Inspect the following code:**

```java
// Create a Scanner using the InputStream "System.in"
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a path to the file: ");  // prompt the user
String filePath = input.nextLine(); // Save the user input to a variable
File dataFile = new File(filePath); // Create a File object referencing the path

// Create a Scanner using the File "dataFile"
try (Scanner dataInput = new Scanner(dataFile)) {
    // Loop, read and print out the file line-by-line
    while (dataInput.hasNextLine()) {
        String lineOfInput = dataInput.nextLine();
        System.out.println(lineOfInput);
    }
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    System.err.println("The file does not exist.");
}
```

**This code creates two `Scanner` objects - one to read input from the terminal, and one to read a file. You can do this because the Scanner class defines multiple constructors: one constructor accepts an `InputStream` (System.in, the user's terminal), and another constructor accepts a `File` object.**

**This is an example of using:**

○ Inheritance

○ Polymorphism

○ Operator overloading

◉ Method overloading

○ Method overriding

**Explanation:** A constructor is a method, and overloading the method means creating multiple implementations, each of which accepts a different set of arguments.
