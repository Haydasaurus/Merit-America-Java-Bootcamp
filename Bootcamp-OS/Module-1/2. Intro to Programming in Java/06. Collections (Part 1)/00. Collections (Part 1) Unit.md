# Array recap

When you first learned about arrays, you were taught to declare one by defining its data type and how many elements it holds using this syntax:

```java
int[] ages = new int[3];            // an array, size 3, of integers
String[] groceries = new String[5]; // an array, size 5, of Strings
```

Although arrays are a convenient way to work with a collection of values, they come with a significant limitation. Once you create an array, its size is **_fixed_**.

The `groceries` array only has room for five items: "bananas", "cheese", "pretzels", "rice", and "walnuts." You can't add a sixth, even if you need to add "chocolate." While there are ways to work around this limitation, they're inconvenient and time-consuming.

For instance, if you want to insert a new element into the middle of an array, you'd need to:

1.  Create a new array `B` that's larger than the existing array `A` by 1.
2.  Copy all elements from array `A` to array `B` up until the place you wish to insert after.
3.  Insert the new value into array `B`.
4.  Copy the remaining elements from array `A` to array `B`.
5.  Throw out array `A`.

At first glance, this seems doable. There's a small performance hit as the code creates, copies, inserts, and finally discards the original array. However, the `groceries` array only has five items, so it's an acceptable tradeoff.

But if the `groceries` array had 500 items, you'd be in trouble. If adding to, removing from, and rearranging items in the array is a key feature of a given application which might be performed multiple times in a single session, your application's performance would suffer.

The need to handle lists of unknown size is so common that the Java language contains several special classes to handle this. These classes belong to the Collections library.

# Collections library

## Data structures
Arrays and the classes in the Collections library are generally referred to as **data structures**. A data structure is a collection of values, the relationships among the values, and the operations that can be performed on the values.

For example, an array contains values where each element is contiguous to the next in a fixed block of memory. The array allows indexing to each element to read or write the indexed value.

You don't need to understand the internal implementations of the various data structures in the Collections library, but it's important to understand the purpose and usage of the various classes. Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages and allows particular operations based on its overall purpose.

## Importing the Collections library
Unlike arrays, which are built directly into the Java language, you need to import the Collections library to use it in your code. To do this, you use an `import` statement.

Well-designed Java libraries like Collections gather all the classes that make them up into containers called "packages." You'll learn more about packages later.

Packages are important here because it's the Collections package as a whole, or the individual classes within it, that you'll import.

For example, the first Collections classes discussed are `java.util.List` and `java.util.ArrayList`. You import them into your code with the following `import` statements:

```java
package com.techelevator;

// Importing List and ArrayList
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Exercise {
    ...
}
```

`import` statements always appear between the `package` and `class` lines.

You could omit the `import` statement, but you'd have to refer to all data types with a full package name, like `java.util.List`. Once the `import` statement is used, you can define it as `List` instead.

If you're interested in learning more about `import`, go to [Java Tutorials: Using Package Members](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/usepkgs.html) .

## Types and type-safety
All the Collections classes are type-safe. As with arrays, you must declare a data type for each class in the library. The most commonly used Collections class is `List<T>`.

`List` is the name of the class, while `<T>` is shorthand notation that means "a data type goes here." So, when you see `List<T>`, it means you supply a data type where the `T` is. Some examples include `List<String>`, `List<Integer>`, and `List<Employee>`.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: The combined data type**
>
>The data type of Collections classes like `List<T>` is a combination of the class name plus the data type the class contains.

So, `List<String>` is a different data type than `List<Integer>`, which are both different from `List<Employee>`. The data types are described as "a list of strings", "a list of integers", and "a list of employees."

Anywhere you see a `T` between the two angle-brackets `<>`, you provide a type. Some Collection classes require multiple data types, so `<T, T>` means you need to supply two types. The types don't have to be the same, and in many cases they won't be:

```java
<String, Integer>
<Integer, Employee>
```

Once you've declared the types of data the Collections class contains, the Java compiler prevents you from using a different type:

```java
// Assuming a list of names as Strings, you can't add an integer
names.add(23);  // Compilation error: invalid data type
```

---

# Lists

The `List<T>` is the most common collection class used in the Java language. Like an array, a `List` serves as a general-purpose, type-safe collection of values.

Also, like an array, you access the values by a **zero-based** index. The primary difference between the two is that `List`s can grow and shrink in size, while arrays are always fixed in length.

Another important distinction for `List`s is they maintain the order in which items were added. The first item added is index 0, and the second is index 1.

When a data structure such as a `List` is said to be **_ordered_**, it's referring to the order in which items were added, and not to any alphabetical or other **_sort_** order.

If you add "porcupine", "whale", "bat", and "monkey" to a list of animal names, the order of the list and the indexes of the values are:

![Ordered list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164616765-a7fe8fd6-4710-4f86-96f5-070f541f2ea8.png)

> Note: the animal names aren't _sorted_ in any order except in which they were added.

## Creating new lists
Before you can create a list, you need to `import` the following Collections classes into your code:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

The syntax for creating a list is `List<T> identifier = new ArrayList<T>()`. So if you want a `List` of `String`s, you'd write:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
```

The `new` keyword sets aside memory to hold an instance of an `ArrayList`. The `ArrayList` constructor `()` is invoked to initialize the instance to an empty list of the type used, in this case a list of strings. Finally, the address of the new instance is assigned to the `names` variable.

### `List` versus `ArrayList`
Notice that the data type for the `names` variable is `List<String>` rather than `ArrayList<String>`. You can think of the `List` as a contract that itemizes all the operations which can be performed on any list, like adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting elements. The `ArrayList` is one class that fulfills the `List` contract.

This is called "programming to an interface", and it lets you write **_polymorphic_**, or interchangeable, code. You can find out more about the collections interfaces at [The Java Tutorials.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html)

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Programming to an interface**
>
>For now, know that it's considered a Java best practice to create an instance of a class that fulfils the contract, and assign it to a variable which represents the contract. **_This is common coding practice within Java, and particularly with all the Collections classes, not just lists._**

### Data types
You aren't limited to creating `List`s of `String`s. You can create lists of any reference data type:

```java
List<LocalDate> dates = new ArrayList<LocalDate>();
List<Integer> amounts = new ArrayList<>();
List<Employee> employee = new ArrayList<Employee>();
List<Airplane> airplanes = new ArrayList<Airplane>();
List<VendingMachine> vendingMachines = new ArrayList<>();
```

The first two examples involve built-in Java data types. The remaining three create lists of user-defined data types: `Employee`, `Airplane`, and `VendingMachine`.

Note that `Integer` and `VendingMachine` data types aren't specified in the `ArrayList` on the right-hand side of the assignment in the sample code. The empty angle-brackets `<>` is called the "diamond operator", and is shorthand for saying, "Use the data type specified in the `List`."

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What about primitives?**
>
>In Java, you can't put a primitive in any of the collection classes. It's a limitation of the language.
>
>But the language's creators didn't want to leave out `int`s completely, so they made an object version of `int`s called `Integer`. In fact, they did that with all the primitive data types, including `Double`, `Character`, and `Boolean`.
>
>These object versions are known as **Wrapper classes**. Wrappers automatically convert primitives to reference types and reference types to primitives. The conversion from primitive to object is called "**autoboxing**", while the reverse, from object to primitive, is known as "**unboxing**."

For more information, see [Autoboxing and Unboxing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html) .

## Adding new value
You use the `add()` method to add new values:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
names.add("Luke");
names.add("Leia");
names.add("Han");
```

You can also create `List`s and initialize them with values if you know them ahead of time:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
```

You can even create and initialize the `List`, and then add more values afterward:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
names.add("Chewbacca"); // names now contains Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca
```

`List`s also have another `add()` method that lets you add a value at a specific index in the array. Remember, the index is zero-based:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
names.add(0, "Chewbacca");   // names now contains Chewbacca, Luke, Leia, Han
```

Finally, like arrays, `List`s allow duplicate values:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
names.add("Leia");   // names now contains Luke, Leia, Han, Leia
```

## Removing values
There are two approaches to removing items from a `List`. The first uses the `remove()` method, passing the value you want to remove:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
names.remove("Luke");   // names now contains Leia, Han
```

If the value specified exists in the list more than once, `remove()` finds and removes only the first instance of the value:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han", "Leia"));
names.remove("Leia");   // names now contains Luke, Han, Leia
```

Alternatively, if you know the specific index of the item you want to remove, you could use the `remove()` method with the index:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
names.remove(1);   // names now contains Luke, Han
```

## Accessing list values
Now that you're working with objects and not arrays, you have to get values out of the `List` differently. You do that with the `get()` method:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));

// SPOILER ALERT! The secret children of Darth Vader: Luke and Leia
System.out.println(
    "SPOILER ALERT! The secret children of Darth Vader: " +
    names.get(0) + " and " + names.get(1)
);
```

### Iterating through the collection
Collections support a model of iteration called enumerators. **Enumerators** are a type that allow you to move forward through a collection, one item at a time. You can use a new loop called a **foreach loop** to do this. The syntax for the foreach loop looks like this:

```java
for(<type> <identifier> : <expression>) {
    <body>
}
```

To do this for your `List` of `String`s, you'd write the following:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
for(String name : names) {
    System.out.println("Character: " + name);
}
```

The name of the collection the foreach loop iterates overâ€”in this example, the variable `names`â€”goes to the right of the `:`. As the loop iterates, it retrieves a value from the collection and needs a place to temporarily hold onto it. This is the purpose of the variable `String name` declared to the left of the `:`. The value from the collection is assigned to the variable which you can use inside the loop, as the code does in `"Character: " + name`.

>**âœ” Tip: Using the foreach loop with arrays**
>
>You can use a foreach loop with arrays, too:
>
>```java
>String[] names = new String[] {"Luke", "Leia", "Han"};
>for(String name : names) {
>    System.out.println("Character: " + name);
>}
>```

You don't have to use a foreach loop. You can also use the regular for loop to move through the list. You'd typically use this approach if you need access to the current item's index:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Luke", "Leia", "Han"));
for(int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++) {
    System.out.println("Character at index " + i + ": " + names.get(i));
}
```

This code sample uses a new method called `size()` in the for loop. It returns the number of elements in the `List`. It's similar to the array `length`, but `size()` reflects the actual number elements in the collection, whereas `length` returns the fixed number of elements of the array.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: `size()` method**
>
>All Collections classes have a `size()` method, which reflects the **_current_** number of elements in the collection.

### for versus foreach loops
You may wonder when to use a for loop and when to use a foreach loop. In fact, you may even be asked that in an interview. Here's some points to consider regarding each:

**foreach**

-   Straightforward syntax
-   Only can move forward from the first item
-   Every item is retrieved
-   Unknown position in the collectionâ€”you don't have access to the index
-   Can't access neighboring items

**for**

-   Difficult syntax
-   Start and end where you want, and can go in reverse direction
-   Your choice to retrieve every item, every other item, every third item, etc.
-   Known position in the collection
-   Can access neighboring items or any item in the collection

## Other methods
This lesson covered some of the more common methods that `List`s contain, but it's important to know that there are many other methods that exist to make your job easier. Explore and experiment with the IntelliSense to see what other methods you can discover.

For more information, see the Java documentation for the [List interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html) and the [ArrayList class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) .

# Stacks

Similar to `List`, but a far less commonly used collection class, is `Stack`. Like the `List` class, `Stack` maintains the order in which items are added to and removed from the collection. In fact, the preservation of the order is the very essence of the `Stack` class.

A `Stack` is a last-in, first-out (**LIFO**) data structure. `Stack`s allow you to "push" and "pop" items on and off the top of the collection.

A commonly used analogy is a stack of dinner trays. Adding or removing trays is only possible at the top.

!["Animate" stack](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164617698-93a520f2-06d2-4170-9d13-d152de7692f0.gif)

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Real world usage**
>
>Stacks are most often used when applications need to implement an **undo feature**. The individual actions the user performs are added, or **_pushed_** onto the stack one action at a time.
>
>When the user decides to "undo" an operation, the most recent action is removed, or **_popped_** off the top of the stack, before it's undone. The second to last action is now at the top. If the user decides to undo another action, the now top action is popped and undone. The process repeats, and subsequent "undoings" result in the actions being undone in the reverse order they were done.

### Creating a `Stack`
To use `Stack`s, use this `import` statement:

```java
import java.util.Stack;
```

The syntax for creating a `Stack` is `Stack<T> identifier = new Stack<T>()`. So if you want a `Stack` of `String`s, you'd write:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();
```

As discussed earlier, the type can be any reference data type you want. Here, you can see a `Stack` that holds `LocalDate` objects, and another one that holds `Integer`s:

```java
Stack<LocalDate> schedule = new Stack<LocalDate>();
Stack<Integer> sequence = new Stack<Integer>();
```

### Adding items to a `Stack`
`Stack`s use a `push()` method instead of `add()`. The `push()` method adds an item to the top of the `Stack`:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();

names.push("C3PO");  // names now contains C3PO
names.push("R2-D2"); // names now contains R2-D2, C3PO
names.push("BB-8");  // names now contains BB-8, R2-D2, C3PO
```

### Removing items from a `Stack`
The method for removing items is `pop()`. This always removes the latest item from the top of the stack:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();

// ... C3PO, then R2-D2, then BB-8 are pushed onto the stack

String name = names.pop();  // name contains BB-8 since that was the last name placed on the stack
                            // and names contains R2-D2, C3PO
```

If you try to `pop()` an empty stack, an `EmptyStackException` exception occurs. It's best to check the `size()` to make sure at least one item exists before calling `pop()`. You can also use a while loop, which you can see an example of in the ["Looping through a stack"](https://lms.techelevator.com/cohorts/42/blocks/7/content_files/06_Collections_Part_1_Lists_Stacks_Queues/04-stacks.md#stack-looping) section below.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Java exceptions**
>
>An **_exception_** is Java's term for an error that occurs while your program is running.

You can learn more about Java Exceptions in [The Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/) .

If you want to check the next item in the `Stack` without removing it, you can use the `peek()` method:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();

// ... C3PO, then R2-D2, then BB-8 are pushed onto the stack

String name = names.pop();  // name contains BB-8 since that was the last name placed on the stack
                            // and names contains R2-D2, C3PO

String peekName = names.peek(); // peekName contains R2-D2
                                // names still contains R2-D2, C3PO
```

### Looping through a `Stack`
`Stack`s don't support a way of accessing specific elements by index. However, you can enumerate through the `Stack` using a foreach loop:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();

//... push names on to the stack

for(String name : names) {
    // The name isn't removed from the stack.
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

When you enumerate using a foreach loop, you can safely read items, but you can't modify any of them. If you want to look at each item and remove it with `pop()`, you'll need a different way such as using a `while` loop:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();

//... push names on to the stack

while (names.size() > 0)
{
    String name = names.pop(); // the next item is removed from the stack
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

### Other methods
This lesson covered the more common methods that `Stack`s contain, but it's important to know that there are many other methods that exist to make your job easier. Explore and experiment with the IntelliSense to see what other methods you can discover.

For more information, see the [Java documentation for the Stack class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html) .

# Queues

Like `Stack`s, `Queue`s are rarely used in general practice. However, like `Stack`s, `Queue`s can also be the perfect collection under certain circumstances, unusual as they may be.

`Queue`s are an "ordered" First-In First-Out (**FIFO**) data structure. New items are added at the end of the collection, and existing items are pulled from the beginning.

![Animate queue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164619039-89b27aa6-45db-4267-89bd-f2dba9740090.gif)

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Real world usage**
>
>`Queue`s are used when there's a need for a system that manages a collection of items in the order the items are added. Some examples are:
>
>1.  A printer uses a queue to print documents in the order requests are made.
>2.  A call center phone system uses a queue to hold customers in the order they call. Service representatives take the call of the person on hold the longest.

### Creating a `Queue`

`Queue`s require the following imports in your code:

```java
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;
```

The syntax for creating a `Queue` is `Queue<T> identifier = new LinkedList<T>()`. So if you want a `Queue` of `String`s, you'd write:

```java
Queue<String> names = new LinkedList<String>();
```

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What's `LinkedList`?**
>
>`LinkedList` is the class that you use in Java to create a `Queue`. It's essentially the "programming to an interface" concept discussed with `List` and `ArrayList`. `Queue` is the contract itemizing all the operations permitted on a queue, while `LinkedList` is the class that fulfils the contract.

As discussed earlier, the type can be any reference data type you want. Here, you create a `Queue` that holds `LocalDate` objects, and another one that holds `Employee`s.

```java
Queue<LocalDate> schedule = new LinkedList<LocalDate>();
Queue<Employee> reviews = new LinkedList<Employee>();
```

### Adding items to a `Queue`

Adding items to the `Queue` is similar to real life, except in the digital world, no one can jump the line. They always go to the end. You use the `offer()` method to add an item to the end of the `Queue`:

```java
Queue<String> names = new LinkedList<String>();

names.offer("C3PO");  // names now contains C3PO
names.offer("R2-D2"); // names now contains C3PO, R2-D2
names.offer("BB-8");  // names now contains C3PO, R2-D2, BB-8
```

### Removing items from a `Queue`

The method for removing items is `poll()`. This always removes the item from the beginning of the `Queue`:

```java
Queue<String> names = new LinkedList<String>();

// ... names now contains C3PO, R2-D2, BB-8

String name = names.poll(); // name contains C3PO and names contains R2-D2, BB-8
```

If you try to call `poll()` when the `Queue` is empty, `null` is returned. It's always best to check the `size()` before attempting to poll an item.

### Looping through a `Queue`

As with `Stack`s, you can use the foreach iterator to go through the contents of a `Queue`. Alternatively, you can dequeue each item as long as there are items in the `Queue`:

```java
Queue<String> names = new LinkedList<String>();

// ... names now contains C3PO, R2-D2, BB-8

while (names.size() > 0)
{
    String name = names.poll(); // the item is removed from the queue
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

### Other methods

This lesson covered the more common methods that `Queue`s contain, but it's important to know that there are many other methods that exist to make your job easier. Explore and experiment with the IntelliSense to see what other methods you can discover.

For more information, see the Java documentation for the [Queue interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html) and the [LinkedList class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) .

# Unit summary

The collections introduced in this unit are examples of **_ordered_** data structures. A data structure refers to a particular way the data is organized so that it can be used by the program. An ordered data structure is a data structure whose elements have a particular sequence.

You've learned about list, stacks, and queues. While these ordered data structures are the most commonly used, there are many, many more. You may want to explore these others:

-   **Linked-Lists** are a foundational data structure, and have many uses directly, or indirectly as part of a larger data structure.
-   **Trees** are often used to maintain a hierarchy of parent, children, and sibling relationships of data, like a file system.
-   **Graphs** show how two different pieces of data are connected. Graphs are often seen in social networking and path-finding/GPS algorithms.

# Quiz

## **Collections (Part 1) - Lists, Stacks, Queues 1**

**Select the ways a `List` differs from an array (select all that apply):**

	Select all correct options

â–  A `List`'s length doesn't need to be declared.

â–¡ Each element can hold a different data type in a `List`.

â–  You can add or remove elements from the middle of a `List`.

â–¡ You can't access a `List` element at a particular index.

â–  You use a different method to retrieve the number of elements in a `List`.

**Explanation:**
-   A `List` grows and shrinks as it's needed, unlike an array that has a fixed length.
-   `List`s have methods that you can use to add and remove elements from the middle of a `List`, unlike arrays.
-   `List`s have a different method for retrieving the number of elements.


## **Collections (Part 1) - Lists, Stacks, Queues 2**

**What does the `<T>` indicate when used like `List<T>`?**

â—‹ It means that it's a collection.

â—‹ The `List` can only hold a data type called `T`.

â—‰ You need to specify a data type in place of `T`.

â—‹ Nothing. It's a typo.

**Explanation:** The `T` is a placeholder for a data type to be specified by the developer. The data type goes in the angle brackets `<>`.


## **Collections (Part 1) - Lists, Stacks, Queues 3**

**Given this `List` declaration, how do you write a foreach loop to iterate through its elements?**

```java
List<Integer> scores = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(80, 94, 81, 75, 91, 98, 84));
```

â—‹ `for (each score in scores)`

â—‰ `for (Integer score : scores)`

â—‹ `for (score in scores)`

â—‹ `for (scores => score)`

**Explanation:** This is the correct syntax for a foreach loop.


## **Collections (Part 1) - Lists, Stacks, Queues 4**

**What method do you use to get the number of elements in a `List`?**

â—‹ `length()`

â—‹ `amount()`

â—‰ `size()`

â—‹ `count()`

**Explanation:** This is the correct method.


## **Collections (Part 1) - Lists, Stacks, Queues 5**

**Given a `List<String>`, what does the following line of code do?**

```java
myList.add(1, "My Text");
```

â—‹ Adds "My Text" as the first item in `myList`.

â—‰ Adds "My Text" as the second item in `myList`.

â—‹ Adds the values `1` and "My Text" to `myList`.

â—‹ Overwrites the element at that position in `myList`.

**Explanation:** This is correct. The 1 indicates the zero-based index of where to insert the item.


## **Collections (Part 1) - Lists, Stacks, Queues 6**

**Given this `List` declaration, how do you access the **_third_** item?**

```java
List<String> animals = 
    new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Dog", "Cat", "Fish", "Bear"));
```

â—‰ `animals.get(2)`

â—‹ `animals.get(3)`

â—‹ `animals.get("Fish")`

â—‹ `animals[2]`

**Explanation:** Correct. `List's` are zero-based indexes like arrays, so you use the `get()` method.


## **Collections (Part 1) - Lists, Stacks, Queues 7**

**You can use a foreach loop on not only `List`s, but arrays too.**

â—‰ True

â—‹ False
