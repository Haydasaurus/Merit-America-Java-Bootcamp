# Queues

Like `Stack`s, `Queue`s are rarely used in general practice. However, like `Stack`s, `Queue`s can also be the perfect collection under certain circumstances, unusual as they may be.

`Queue`s are an "ordered" First-In First-Out (**FIFO**) data structure. New items are added at the end of the collection, and existing items are pulled from the beginning.

>`Queue`s are used when there's a need for a system that manages a collection of items in the order the items are added. Some examples are:

>1.  A printer uses a queue to print documents in the order requests are made.
>2.  A call center phone system uses a queue to hold customers in the order they call. Service representatives take the call of the person on hold the longest.

### Creating a `Queue`

`Queue`s require the following imports in your code:

```java
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;
```

The syntax for creating a `Queue` is `Queue<T> identifier = new LinkedList<T>()`. So if you want a `Queue` of `String`s, you'd write:

```java
Queue<String> names = new LinkedList<String>();
```

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What's `LinkedList`?**
>
>`LinkedList` is the class that you use in Java to create a `Queue`. It's essentially the "programming to an interface" concept discussed with `List` and `ArrayList`. `Queue` is the contract itemizing all the operations permitted on a queue, while `LinkedList` is the class that fulfils the contract.

As discussed earlier, the type can be any reference data type you want. Here, you create a `Queue` that holds `LocalDate` objects, and another one that holds `Employee`s.

```java
Queue<LocalDate> schedule = new LinkedList<LocalDate>();
Queue<Employee> reviews = new LinkedList<Employee>();
```

### Adding items to a `Queue`

Adding items to the `Queue` is similar to real life, except in the digital world, no one can jump the line. They always go to the end. You use the `offer()` method to add an item to the end of the `Queue`:

```java
Queue<String> names = new LinkedList<String>();

names.offer("C3PO");  // names now contains C3PO
names.offer("R2-D2"); // names now contains C3PO, R2-D2
names.offer("BB-8");  // names now contains C3PO, R2-D2, BB-8
```

### Removing items from a `Queue`

The method for removing items is `poll()`. This always removes the item from the beginning of the `Queue`:

```java
Queue<String> names = new LinkedList<String>();

// ... names now contains C3PO, R2-D2, BB-8

String name = names.poll(); // name contains C3PO and names contains R2-D2, BB-8
```

If you try to call `poll()` when the `Queue` is empty, `null` is returned. It's always best to check the `size()` before attempting to poll an item.

### Looping through a `Queue`

As with `Stack`s, you can use the foreach iterator to go through the contents of a `Queue`. Alternatively, you can dequeue each item as long as there are items in the `Queue`:

```java
Queue<String> names = new LinkedList<String>();

// ... names now contains C3PO, R2-D2, BB-8

while (names.size() > 0)
{
    String name = names.poll(); // the item is removed from the queue
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

### Other methods

This lesson covered the more common methods that `Queue`s contain, but it's important to know that there are many other methods that exist to make your job easier. Explore and experiment with the IntelliSense to see what other methods you can discover.
