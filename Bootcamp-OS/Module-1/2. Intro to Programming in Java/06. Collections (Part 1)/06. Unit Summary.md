# Unit summary

The collections introduced in this unit are examples of **_ordered_** data structures. A data structure refers to a particular way the data is organized so that it can be used by the program. An ordered data structure is a data structure whose elements have a particular sequence.

You've learned about list, stacks, and queues. While these ordered data structures are the most commonly used, there are many, many more. You may want to explore these others:

-   **Linked-Lists** are a foundational data structure, and have many uses directly, or indirectly as part of a larger data structure.
-   **Trees** are often used to maintain a hierarchy of parent, children, and sibling relationships of data, like a file system.
-   **Graphs** show how two different pieces of data are connected. Graphs are often seen in social networking and path-finding/GPS algorithms.
