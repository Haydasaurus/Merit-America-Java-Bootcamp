# Command-line programs

In this unit, you'll write programs that interact with a user. These days, when programs interact with a user, they usually do so through a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides visual controls like buttons and toggle switches. Not all programs have a GUI, though. Many system administration and developer tools interact only through text output to the screen and input from the keyboard. These are called **command-line programs**.

At a high-level, a command-line program typically does three things:

1.  Prompts the user to provide input.
2.  Does something with that input.
3.  Outputs the result.

At this point, you've seen methods that perform a calculation, like this one that takes a number of kilometers and returns the equivalent number of miles:

```java
    public double kilometersToMiles(int kilometers) {
        final double MILES_PER_KILOMETER = 0.621371;
        return kilometers * MILES_PER_KILOMETER;
    }
```

A method like that becomes more useful as part of a command-line program. For example, a kilometers-to-miles converter that:

1.  Prompts the user for a number of kilometers.
2.  Calls that `kilometersToMiles` method with the number entered.
3.  Displays the number of miles returned by `kilometersToMiles`.

# Standard I/O

To write command-line programs, you'll need to use the **standard streams**. Streams are abstractions provided by the operating system for sending data to and receiving data from a wide variety of devices.

Along with the code that does the specific calculations or computation needed for your program, you'll leverage the standard streams for input and output (I/O).

For the command-line programs you write early on, the standard input stream ("standard in") is the keyboard, and the standard output stream ("standard out") is the window of the terminal application which launched the program.

## Where does standard input fit in?
You can use `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()` to print a message to standard out, but how do you get information from standard in? The answer is to create a new `Scanner` using `System.in` and then use the `nextLine()` method.

Here is an example of using the two methods together to prompt the user to enter a value:

```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a value: ");  // prints out a message
String userInput = input.nextLine();  // saves what the user types in userInput
```

After the program runs these lines, `userInput` holds whatever the keyboard input the user typed before they pressed enter.

# Reading the IntelliSense

Before you keep reading, make sure you understand what happened with that `nextLine()` method in the previous lesson:

```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a value: ");  // prints out a message
String userInput = input.nextLine();  // saves what the user types in userInput
```

Here's what this code does:

1.  It invokes a method that reads keyboard input up until but not including when they press enter.
2.  Then it saves the output that method returned into a string variable named `userInput`.

While it does take some time to learn the Java language, how do you know to use a `string` and not an `int`? **_IntelliSense_**. Learning to read IntelliSense, and realizing it's impossible for all developers to remember everything, is the key to becoming great at writing code.

![Java IntelliSense](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164611914-246485cc-d5fe-46c4-a327-50d1959d7d51.png)

When hovering over a method, the IntelliSense window appears. By reading it, you can see these important things:

1.  **Return type** - The return type indicates what the method expression evaluates to. If you want to save the value in a variable, you must match the return type. If you tried using another type, such as `int`, there would be a data type mismatch.
2.  **Method name** - The method name here indicates exactly what you must type so the program _invokes_ this method.
3.  **Parameters** - Some methods require parameters, similar to required fields on a web page. If they're not provided, or the data types don't match, then the code won't compile.

Additionally, the IntelliSense often provides a short description that indicates what the method does. Any description or possible exceptions that it can trigger are helpful since you didn't write these methods yourself.

Think of these methods as opaque boxes. You don't need to know how it works internally, but you do need to know what output it provides, and what, if anything, may go wrong.

# Parsing strings

You're probably thinking, "Great—now I've got a string, but I wanted a number." Unfortunately, you can't tell the framework to only accept numbers, but you can **_parse_** the characters your users type and try to turn it into a number.

Fortunately, all of the primitive data types offer a parsing method which accepts a `string` and converts it into the desired data type:

![Integer.parseInt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164612259-c4776a57-dbe0-4e4a-afcb-e808af3550d1.png)

The IntelliSense for this one looks a bit different than the `nextLine()` method used earlier on. There are two things to notice here:

1.  **Return Type** - The return type indicates that this method returns an `int`.
2.  **Parameters** - The IntelliSense shown indicates that the value provided **_must be a string_**. Using anything which can't be implicitly converted into a `string` results in a data mismatch.

>**✔ Tip: Using parameter values**

>The IntelliSense indicates that you need to pass in a `String` for the program to compile correctly. This means you can pass in:
>
>1.  a literal string, like `"5"`
>2.  a string variable
>3.  a method expression which returns a string, like `input.nextLine()`

You'll also see that in the list of available methods, there are other methods called `parseInt` on the `Integer` class. These are **overloads**. Overloads are methods that have the same name but take different parameters, so you can use a different one depending on your needs.
