# Command-Line programs

In this unit, you'll write programs that interact with a user. These days, when programs interact with a user, they usually do so through a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides visual controls like buttons and toggle switches. Not all programs have a GUI, though. Many system administration and developer tools interact only through text output to the screen and input from the keyboard. These are called **command-line programs**.

At a high-level, a command-line program typically does three things:

1.  Prompts the user to provide input.
2.  Does something with that input.
3.  Outputs the result.

At this point, you've seen methods that perform a calculation, like this one that takes a number of kilometers and returns the equivalent number of miles:

```java
    public double kilometersToMiles(int kilometers) {
        final double MILES_PER_KILOMETER = 0.621371;
        return kilometers * MILES_PER_KILOMETER;
    }
```

A method like that becomes more useful as part of a command-line program. For example, a kilometers-to-miles converter that:

1.  Prompts the user for a number of kilometers.
2.  Calls that `kilometersToMiles` method with the number entered.
3.  Displays the number of miles returned by `kilometersToMiles`.
