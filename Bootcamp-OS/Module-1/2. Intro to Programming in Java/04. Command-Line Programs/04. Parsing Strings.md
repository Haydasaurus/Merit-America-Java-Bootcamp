# Parsing strings

You're probably thinking, "Great—now I've got a string, but I wanted a number." Unfortunately, you can't tell the framework to only accept numbers, but you can **_parse_** the characters your users type and try to turn it into a number.

Fortunately, all of the primitive data types offer a parsing method which accepts a `string` and converts it into the desired data type:

The IntelliSense for this one looks a bit different than the `nextLine()` method used earlier on. There are two things to notice here:

1.  **Return Type** - The return type indicates that this method returns an `int`.
2.  **Parameters** - The IntelliSense shown indicates that the value provided **_must be a string_**. Using anything which can't be implicitly converted into a `string` results in a data mismatch.

>2.  a string variable
>3.  a method expression which returns a string, like `input.nextLine()`

You'll also see that in the list of available methods, there are other methods called `parseInt` on the `Integer` class. These are **overloads**. Overloads are methods that have the same name but take different parameters, so you can use a different one depending on your needs.
