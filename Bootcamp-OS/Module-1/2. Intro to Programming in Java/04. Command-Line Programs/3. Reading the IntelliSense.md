# Reading the IntelliSense

Before you keep reading, make sure you understand what happened with that `nextLine()` method in the previous lesson:

```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a value: ");  // prints out a message
String userInput = input.nextLine();  // saves what the user types in userInput
```

Here's what this code does:

1.  It invokes a method that reads keyboard input up until but not including when they press enter.
2.  Then it saves the output that method returned into a string variable named `userInput`.

While it does take some time to learn the Java language, how do you know to use a `string` and not an `int`? **_IntelliSense_**. Learning to read IntelliSense, and realizing it's impossible for all developers to remember everything, is the key to becoming great at writing code.

When hovering over a method, the IntelliSense window appears. By reading it, you can see these important things:

1.  **Return type** - The return type indicates what the method expression evaluates to. If you want to save the value in a variable, you must match the return type. If you tried using another type, such as `int`, there would be a data type mismatch.
2.  **Method name** - The method name here indicates exactly what you must type so the program _invokes_ this method.
3.  **Parameters** - Some methods require parameters, similar to required fields on a web page. If they're not provided, or the data types don't match, then the code won't compile.

Additionally, the IntelliSense often provides a short description that indicates what the method does. Any description or possible exceptions that it can trigger are helpful since you didn't write these methods yourself.

Think of these methods as opaque boxes. You don't need to know how it works internally, but you do need to know what output it provides, and what, if anything, may go wrong.
