# Finally

While the Java runtime handles most memory management for you, sometimes you need to dispose of resources when you're done with them.

For example:

-   Databases have a finite number of connections. Your applications need to close connections when done with them.
-   Files are "locked" when opened, prohibiting other applications from seeing or making modifications.
-   You may need to release lower-level graphics resources.

You know when exceptions are thrown, the statements in the `catch` block are called and your program never returns to the `try` block. The `catch` block might return from the method itself or throw additional exceptions. It's possible that code after the try-catch may never run and resources are never cleared out:

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Code that catches the exception
}

// Code that is not guaranteed to execute
```

Java provides the `finally` block, which you can add to a try-catch. Statements inside of a `finally` block run whether an exception occurred or not:

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Code that catches the exception
} finally {
    // Code that executes whether an exception
    // is thrown or not.
}
```
