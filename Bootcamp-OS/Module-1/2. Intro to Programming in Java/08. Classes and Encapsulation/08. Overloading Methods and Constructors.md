# Overloading methods and constructors

To provide users of your class with different options when they instantiate new objects or invoke methods, you can create an **overloaded method** or **overloaded constructor**.

As a programmer, when you overload a method or constructor, you add flexibility to your class so that users can leverage different inputs when interacting with it.

There are three rules of an overloaded method:

1.  Overloaded methods must **_have the same name_**.
2.  Overloaded methods must **_differ in the number of parameters, parameter types, or both_**.
3.  Overloaded methods can have different return types, but that **_must not_** be the only difference.

## Method overloading
In the following example, an overloaded method allows the programmer to "tick" the clock many times:

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    // Constructor
    public Clock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.second = second;
    }

    // Overloaded method, relies on other tick method
    // but allows users to pass an int to say how many
    // times it ticks
    public void tick(int numberOfTimes) {
        for(int i = 1; i <= numberOfTimes; i++) {
            this.tick();    // calls tick() method below
        }
    }

    public void tick() {
        ///..
    }
}
```

```java
// Program.java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Clock grandfather = new Clock(11, 17, 42);

    // tick the clock 5 times
    grandfather.tick(5);// time will now be 11:17:47

    // tick the clock 1 time
    grandfather.tick(); // time will now be 11:17:48

    // Prints "Current time is 11:17:48
    System.out.println("Current time is " + grandfather.getCurrentTime());
}
```

>-   The method parameters and the order of their data types
>
>The two `tick` methods have the signatures:
>
>-   `tick(int)`
>-   `tick()`
>
>A method signature is a way to differentiate overloaded methods, but it's also commonly used by programmers to describe any method.

>```java
>public String sendBirthdayGreeting(String name, int age) {
>    ....
>}
>```

>The seasoned Java programmer says, "The method, `sendBirthdayGreeting`, has two parameters, a `String` and an `int`, and returns a `String`."

## Overloaded constructors
In the following code, an overloaded constructor allows the programmer to create a clock with specific values when instantiating a new clock:

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    private int hour = 7;       // Assigning values in order to
    private int minute = 45;    // default clock to 07:45:00 for
    private int second;         // demonstration purposes only

    // Constructor
    public Clock() {
        // Defaults established in property declarations.
    }

    // Overloaded Constructor
    public Clock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.second = second;
    }
}
```

```java
// Program.java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Clock grandfather = new Clock(11, 17, 42);

    // Prints "Current time is 11:17:42"
    System.out.println("Current time is " + grandfather.getCurrentTime());

    Clock watch = new Clock();

    // Prints "Current time is 07:45:00"
    System.out.println("Current time is " + watch.getCurrentTime());
}
```

> Note: The default constructor `Clock()` doesn't set default values for `hour`, `minute`, and `second`, but it relies upon the values assigned in the property declaration.
