# Extending classes

Look at the `Clock` class from a previous unit:

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    // Overloaded Constructor
    public Clock() {
        this.hour = 0;
        this.minute = 0;
        this.second = 0;
    }

    // Constructor
    public Clock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.second = second;
    }

    public void tick() {
        this.second += 1;

        if (this.second >= 60) {
            this.minute += 1;
            this.second = 0;
        }

        if (this.minute >= 60) {
            this.hour += 1;
            this.minute = 0;
        }

        if (this.hour >= 24) {
            this.hour = 0;
        }
    }

    // Getters and setters
    public String getCurrentTime() {
        return String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", this.hour, this.minute, this.second);
    }

    public void setHour(int hour) {
        this.hour = hour;
    }

    public void setMinute(int minute) {
        this.minute = minute;
    }

    public void setSecond(int second) {
        this.second = second;
    }

    public int getHour() {
        return this.hour;
    }

    public int getMinute() {
        return this.minute;
    }

    public int getSecond() {
        return this.second;
    }
}
```

This class defines some basic behavior for a basic clock. In fact, every clock needs the same capability.

But every clock is different, too.

Say, for example, that you want to define some different clocks that make different sounds. First, you'd define a `GrandfatherClock` class that ticks and tocks every time you call `tick()`.

You could copy and paste all the code from `Clock` into a new class called `GrandfatherClock`, but it's best not to, as this violates the DRY Principle: **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself.

Instead, you can have `GrandfatherClock` inherit the code from `Clock`:

```java
// GrandfatherClock.java
public class GrandfatherClock extends Clock {

    public GrandfatherClock() {
        super();
    }

    public GrandfatherClock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        super(hour, minute, second);
    }
}
```

This is all you have to do to make a new `GrandfatherClock` class that behaves like a regular `Clock`. The two constructors, `GrandfatherClock()` and `GrandfatherClock(hour, minute, second)`, each call the special `super()` method. When a subclass calls `super()` in one of its constructors, it runs the code in the corresponding superclass's constructor.

Next, add a tick-tock sound to the `GrandfatherClock`:

```java
// GrandfatherClock.java
public class GrandfatherClock extends Clock {

    public GrandfatherClock() {
        super();
    }

    public GrandfatherClock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        super(hour, minute, second);
    }

    public void tick() {
        super.tick();
        if (getSecond() % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("tick");
        } else {
            System.out.println("tock");
        }
    }
}
```

Here, you can see the use of the `super` special variable. Once you've created your object, you can use the `super` variable to call code from your superclass. You want the `GrandfatherClock`'s `tick()` method to behave like the `Clock`'s `tick()` method, but with some extra capability.

Your `tick()` method **overrides** the super `tick()` method. You didn't have to call `super.tick()` but if you didn't, the original tick code wouldn't run. So, you run the original tick code first and then add in your special capability for `GrandfatherClock`.

Now, make a `CuckooClock`. A `CuckooClock` makes a Cuckoo sound at every hour:

```java
// CuckooClock.java
public class CuckooClock extends Clock {

    public CuckooClock() {
        super();
    }

    public CuckooClock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        super(hour, minute, second);
    }

    public void tick() {
        super.tick();
        if (getSecond() == 0 && getMinute() == 0) {
            System.out.println("cuckoo cuckoo");
        }
    }
}
```

You now have two new clocks sharing the same capability of `Clock`, but with their own special features.
