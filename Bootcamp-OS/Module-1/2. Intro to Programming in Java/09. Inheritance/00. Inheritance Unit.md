# Inheritance

Another OOP principle is **Inheritance**, which is the act of having one class adopt the properties and methods of another class. This prevents code duplication and allows you to share code across classes while having the source code live in only one class file.

## Class hierarchies

Using inheritance to organize your classes allows you to build a class hierarchy of your code. You could think of inheritance as a parent-child relationship.

![Hierarchy of Clocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164745263-da35ba03-12a2-4833-8fff-ff8f8bb07ad8.png)

In the example, there is a variety of different types of clocks that you must define in your code. They're arranged here in a hierarchy.

Both `GrandfatherClock` and `CuckooClock` are types of clocks. The `Clock` class defines all the characteristics of what a clock is, such as holding the hours, minutes, seconds, and advancing the time. `GrandfatherClock` and `CuckooClock` adopt these characteristics. They then add their own characteristics, like the pendulum of the `GrandfatherClock` or the little bird that comes out of the `CuckooClock`. They may look different, but they're still fundamentally clocks.

In fact, programmers would say that if a `GrandfatherClock` inherits from `Clock`, then a `GrandfatherClock` object _IS A_ `Clock`. `GrandfatherClock` is the **subclass** and `Clock` is the **superclass**. This is the same for `CuckooClock`. `CuckooClock` is the **subclass** and `Clock` is the **superclass**.

Another thing to notice is that `AlarmClock` is a **subclass** of `Clock`, but it's also a **superclass** of `DigitalAlarmClock`. This means that `DigitalAlarmClock` IS A `AlarmClock` and IS A `Clock`. It inherits the properties and methods from all of the classes above it in the hierarchy.

# Extending classes

Look at the `Clock` class from a previous unit:

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    // Overloaded Constructor
    public Clock() {
        this.hour = 0;
        this.minute = 0;
        this.second = 0;
    }

    // Constructor
    public Clock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.second = second;
    }

    public void tick() {
        this.second += 1;

        if (this.second >= 60) {
            this.minute += 1;
            this.second = 0;
        }

        if (this.minute >= 60) {
            this.hour += 1;
            this.minute = 0;
        }

        if (this.hour >= 24) {
            this.hour = 0;
        }
    }

    // Getters and setters
    public String getCurrentTime() {
        return String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", this.hour, this.minute, this.second);
    }

    public void setHour(int hour) {
        this.hour = hour;
    }

    public void setMinute(int minute) {
        this.minute = minute;
    }

    public void setSecond(int second) {
        this.second = second;
    }

    public int getHour() {
        return this.hour;
    }

    public int getMinute() {
        return this.minute;
    }

    public int getSecond() {
        return this.second;
    }
}
```

This class defines some basic behavior for a basic clock. In fact, every clock needs the same capability.

But every clock is different, too.

Say, for example, that you want to define some different clocks that make different sounds. First, you'd define a `GrandfatherClock` class that ticks and tocks every time you call `tick()`.

You could copy and paste all the code from `Clock` into a new class called `GrandfatherClock`, but it's best not to, as this violates the DRY Principle: **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself.

Instead, you can have `GrandfatherClock` inherit the code from `Clock`:

```java
// GrandfatherClock.java
public class GrandfatherClock extends Clock {

    public GrandfatherClock() {
        super();
    }

    public GrandfatherClock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        super(hour, minute, second);
    }
}
```

This is all you have to do to make a new `GrandfatherClock` class that behaves like a regular `Clock`. The two constructors, `GrandfatherClock()` and `GrandfatherClock(hour, minute, second)`, each call the special `super()` method. When a subclass calls `super()` in one of its constructors, it runs the code in the corresponding superclass's constructor.

Next, add a tick-tock sound to the `GrandfatherClock`:

```java
// GrandfatherClock.java
public class GrandfatherClock extends Clock {

    public GrandfatherClock() {
        super();
    }

    public GrandfatherClock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        super(hour, minute, second);
    }

    public void tick() {
        super.tick();
        if (getSecond() % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("tick");
        } else {
            System.out.println("tock");
        }
    }
}
```

Here, you can see the use of the `super` special variable. Once you've created your object, you can use the `super` variable to call code from your superclass. You want the `GrandfatherClock`'s `tick()` method to behave like the `Clock`'s `tick()` method, but with some extra capability.

Your `tick()` method **overrides** the super `tick()` method. You didn't have to call `super.tick()` but if you didn't, the original tick code wouldn't run. So, you run the original tick code first and then add in your special capability for `GrandfatherClock`.

Now, make a `CuckooClock`. A `CuckooClock` makes a Cuckoo sound at every hour:

```java
// CuckooClock.java
public class CuckooClock extends Clock {

    public CuckooClock() {
        super();
    }

    public CuckooClock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        super(hour, minute, second);
    }

    public void tick() {
        super.tick();
        if (getSecond() == 0 && getMinute() == 0) {
            System.out.println("cuckoo cuckoo");
        }
    }
}
```

You now have two new clocks sharing the same capability of `Clock`, but with their own special features.

---

# A subclass "IS" its superclass

You can create a new instance of `GrandfatherClock` in a program:

```java
GrandfatherClock myClock = new GrandfatherClock();

myClock.tick();
myClock.tick();

String currentTime = myClock.getCurrentTime();
```

But what if you wanted to create a new `CuckooClock` in place of the `GrandfatherClock` later? To do that, you'd change the two references to `GrandfatherClock` to `CuckooClock`, the remainder of the code remains the same:

```java
CuckooClock myClock = new CuckooClock();

myClock.tick();
myClock.tick();

String currentTime = myClock.getCurrentTime();
```

However, because programmers strive to make as few changes as possible to their code, they'll find ways to change even less code than that. You can make the code more flexible by treating a `GrandfatherClock` or `CuckooClock` as a plain `Clock`:

```java
Clock myClock = new CuckooClock();

myClock.tick();
myClock.tick();

String currentTime = myClock.getCurrentTime();
```

Since a `GrandfatherClock` IS A `Clock`, then you can save a `GrandfatherClock` in a `Clock` variable. The same goes for `CuckooClock`. This lets you dynamically choose which kind of clock you want:

```java
Clock myClock;
if(choice.equals("cuckoo")) {
    myClock = new CuckooClock();
} else {
    myClock = new GrandfatherClock();
}

myClock.tick();
myClock.tick();

String currentTime = myClock.getCurrentTime();
```

If you think about it, inheritance is very powerful. You could define different kinds of clocks, but use the same code to work with all of them. As long as your code knows how to work with a `Clock` object, it can also work with any object from a class that inherits the `Clock`.

## Every class is a `java.lang.Object`

In Java, every class is, either directly or indirectly, a subclass of `java.lang.Object` (or `Object`). If you define a class, but don't use the `extends` keyword to subclass another class, then your class is a direct subclass of `Object`. Look at the previous definition of the `Clock` class:

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    // Clock code here...
}
```

Because `Clock` doesn't explicitly extend another class, it extends `Object`. So a more complete picture of the class hierarchy follows:

![Hierarchy of Clocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164745512-f0971666-9138-4094-9672-f49c045eb4ff.png)

`DigitalAlarmClock` IS A `AlarmClock`, which IS A `Clock`, which IS A `Object`. Therefore `DigitalAlarmClock` inherits all the properties and methods from all of its superclasses, including `Object`. This is also true of all the classes in the Java standard library, like [String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) and [ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html) .

This relationship of `Object` to all other classes is sometimes stated, "`Object` is the root of the Java class hierarchy." As a matter of fact, even the [Java documentation for Object](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html) says it this way.

# Quiz

For questions 1 & 2, refer to the following diagram:

![Hierarchy of Clocks - Quiz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164745681-ef855b7d-f012-41e4-a554-f7185d954757.png)

## **Inheritance 1**

**The inheritance relationship can be described by filling in the blank with which phrase?**

**Square _____________ Rectangle**

○ "has a"

◉ "is a"

○ "contains a"

○ "looks like a"

**Explanation:** Correct. The litmus test for whether two classes should be in an inheritance relationship is if you can affirm "subclass **_is a_** superclass."


## **Inheritance 2**

**`Rectangle` inherits from (extends) which classes?**

	Select all correct options

□ String

■ Object

■ Shape

□ Square

□ Triangle

□ Ellipse

**Explanation:** A class inherits from every class "above" it in the hierarchy. `Object` is implicitly at the top of the class hierarchy.


## **Inheritance 3**

**When a subclass provides a different implementation for a method of its superclass, this is called:**

○ method overloading

◉ method overriding

○ method inheritance

○ method replacement

**Explanation:** Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that's defined in the superclass.


Refer to the following code for questions 4-6:

```java
// ###########################
// Alpha.java
// ###########################
public class Alpha {
    public String getOpinion( ) {
        return "Alpha is best!";
    }
}

// ###########################
// Bravo.java
// ###########################
public class Bravo extends Alpha {
     public String getOpinion( ) {
          return "Bravo is best!";
     }
}

// ###########################
// Charlie.java
// ###########################
public class Charlie extends Bravo {

}

// ###########################
// Delta.java
// ###########################
public class Delta extends Alpha {

}
```

## **Inheritance 4**

**What value is returned by calling the `getOpinion()` method on an instance of Alpha?**

◉ "Alpha is best!"

○ "Bravo is best!"

○ "Charlie is best!"

○ "Delta is best!"

**Explanation:** `Alpha` doesn't explicitly extend any other class and uses its own implementation of `getOpinion()` which returns `"Alpha is best!"`.


## **Inheritance 5**

**What value is returned by calling the `getOpinion()` method on an instance of Charlie?**

○ "Alpha is best!"

◉ "Bravo is best!"

○ "Charlie is best!"

○ "Delta is best!"

**Explanation:** `Bravo` extends `Alpha` and overrides `Alpha`'s `getOpinion()` with its own implementation of `getOpinion()` which returns `"Bravo is best!"`.


## **Inheritance 6**

**What value is returned by calling the `getOpinion()` method on an instance of Delta?**

◉ "Alpha is best!"

○ "Bravo is best!"

○ "Charlie is best!"

○ "Delta is best!"

**Explanation:** `Delta` extends `Alpha` and inherits `Alpha`'s implementation of `getOpinion()` which returns `"Alpha is best!"`.


## **Inheritance 7**

Consider the following class definitions:

```java
// Rectangle.java
public class Rectangle {
    private int length;
    private int width;

    // Constructor
    public Rectangle(int length, int width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public int getArea() {
        return this.length * this.width;
    }
}

// Square.java
public class Square extends Rectangle {

    // Constructor
    public Square(int edgeLength) {
        // What code should be added here?
    }
}
```

**What must you add to the Square constructor to make this code work properly?**

○ `new Rectangle(length, width);`

◉ `super(edgeLength, edgeLength);`

○ `Rectangle(edgeLength, edgeLength);`

○ `this(length, width);`

○ Nothing needs to be added, this code works properly.

**Explanation:** The special `super()` method allows code in the subclass constructor to call a superclass constructor. In this case, since the `Square` constructor defines only one parameter (the length of any edge), it calls the `Rectangle` constructor using `super()`, passing in the edge length as both the length and width of the rectangle.
