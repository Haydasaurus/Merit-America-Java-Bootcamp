# Introduction

`List`s are **_fast_** for reading data. You can retrieve any item in a `List` by its index. However, searching through a `List` is another matter. Imagine you have a `List` of animal names, and you need to find the "giraffe." Further imagine that the `List` has 5,000 items:

```java
// Assumes 'animalNames' list has already been created
for (String name : animalNames) {
    if (name.equalsIgnoreCase("giraffe")) {
        System.out.println("Found: " + name);
        break; // You may break out of foreach loops, just like for loops
    }
}
```

Because you don't know what index holds the item you seek, you may need to loop through the entire collection, which is very time consuming and resource intensive. Even worse, you might search through all 5,000 items only to find there's no giraffe.

There are alternatives to a brute-force linear search. For instance, keeping the names sorted alphabetically, and performing a **_binary search_** can help minimize searches, but there is an even better way that avoids iterating through the `List` completely.

# Map

The `Map` class offers a distinct advantage over `List`s. `Map`s consist of key-value pairs where each value is associated with a unique key, and the keys are arranged within the collection so that they can be instantly located and the values retrieved. There is no need to iterate through the collection looking for a particular value.

Here's an example of what a `Map` may hold, where the keys are the names of characters, and the value is a `boolean` indicating whether they're a Jedi or not:

![Key value pairs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164731944-5e6da897-7af1-4b5f-b98e-8fadd10375f2.png)

On the other hand, one disadvantage to `Map`s is they don't maintain order in the sense of keeping track of the order in which items were added.

In other words, `Map`s aren't indexed like `List`s. There's no index, zero-based or otherwise. You can't ask for the first, second, or third item in a `Map`. This is why `Map`s are considered **unordered** data structures.

## Creating a new collection
You'll need to import the following Collections classes to use `Map`s:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;
```

The syntax for creating a `Map` is:

```java
Map<T, T> identifier = new HashMap<T, T>();
```

The first `T` is the data type of the key in the key-value pair of the `Map`. The second `T` is the data type of the value in the pair. The two data types don't have to be the same.

Here's how you create a `Map` of `String` names and `Boolean` Jedi status:

```
Map<String, Boolean> people = new HashMap<String, Boolean>();
```

When it comes to `Map`s, **_keys must be unique_**. Values can repeat.

For example, twins have the same birthday but different names. Although they have the same values (birthday), both can be contained in the same `Map` of names-birthdays, since their keys (name) are different.

>ðŸ›ˆ Warning: Map keys are case-sensitive
>
>Map keys are case-sensitive. A key of `"dog"` isn't the same key as `"DOG"`. They're two distinct and separate keys.

## Adding and updating key-value pairs
To add or update an item to a `Map`, you call the `put()` method:

```java
Map<String, Boolean> people = new HashMap<String, Boolean>();
people.put("Luke", true);
people.put("Han", false);
people.put("Chewbacca", false);
people.put("Yoda", true);
people.put("Leia", true);

// Update Chewie who has been a secret Jedi for many years
people.put("Chewbacca", true);
```

The `put()` method requires two arguments. The first is the key. The second is the value.

If the key doesn't exist, the key-value pair is added. If it does exist, the value is updated.

Remember `Map` keys are case-sensitive. In the preceding example, what would happen if you wrote `people.put("chewbacca", true)` instead of `people.put("Chewbacca", true)`?

Because `"chewbacca"` and `"Chewbacca"` are distinct and separate keys, the `Map` would now have a new `"chewbacca":true` key-value pair while the original `"Chewbacca"` remains `false`.

## Removing key-value pairs
The `remove()` method removes a key-value pair from a `Map`:

```java
Map<String, Boolean> people = new HashMap<String, Boolean>();

// ... map is populated with Luke, Han, Chewbacca, Yoda, and Leia

people.remove("Chewbacca"); // Luke, Han, Yoda, and Leia remain
```

If you want to know if the key-value pair was removed, the `remove()` method returns the value that was associated with the key, and `null` if the key wasn't found:

```java
Map<String, Boolean> people = new HashMap<String, Boolean>();

// ... map is populated with Luke, Han, Chewbacca, Yoda, and Leia

Boolean chewValue = people.remove("Chewbacca");
Boolean landoValue = people.remove("Lando"); // Lando doesn't exist in map

System.out.println("The value for Chewbacca was: " + chewValue);
// outputs "The value for Chewbacca was: false"
System.out.println("The value for Lando was: " + landoValue);
// outputs "The value for Lando was: null"
```

## Accessing values
To access a value from a `Map`, you use the `get()` method, just as you used when accessing values from a `List`. However, instead of using an integer to represent the index, you provide a key value:

```java
Map<String, Boolean> people = new HashMap<String, Boolean>();

// ... map is populated

boolean isLukeJedi = people.get("Luke");
boolean isHanJedi = people.get("Han");
```

This code retrieves a value from the `Map` using a given key. If you provide a key that doesn't exist, `null` is returned.

## Validating the existence of a key-value pair
As mentioned earlier, you can overwrite values by using the `put()` method twice. If you don't want to overwrite a value, you can check if the key already exists.

You can use the `containsKey()` method to determine whether the `Map` contains the specified key:

```java
Map<String, Boolean> people = new HashMap<String, Boolean>();

// ... map is populated

if (people.containsKey("Luke")) {
    /*
     Key *does* exist in the map.
     Accessing or updating a key-value pair is safe, and will behave as expected.
     A new key-value pair will *not* be added as the put() method
     will update an existing key.
     */
} else {
    /*
     Key *doesn't* exist in the map.
     Adding a new key-value pair is safe, and will succeed.
     Attempting to access or update a key-value pair isn't safe, and will fail.
     */
}
```

Like with all other `Map` methods, `containsKey()` is case-sensitive. How you handle the existence or non-existence of a key is outlined in the comments of the sample code.

## Iterating through the collection
Like all the other collections, `Map`s can be enumerated. However, you don't iterate directly over the `Map`. Instead, you loop through the `Map`'s **_entry set_**, which is a collection of the key-value pairs. Each individual item in the entry set is of type `Map.Entry<T, T>`.

To display the names and Jedi status, you iterate over `people.entrySet()` in a foreach loop. After each iteration, the loop assigns the latest entry set retrieved from the collection into the `Map.Entry<String, Boolean> person` variable:

```java
Map<String, Boolean> people = new HashMap<String, Boolean>();

// ... dictionary is populated with Luke, Han, Chewbacca, Yoda, and Leia

for (Map.Entry<String, Boolean> person : people.entrySet()) {
    // person.getValue() will return a boolean
    if (person.getValue()) {
        System.out.println(person.getKey() + " is a Jedi.");
    } else {
        System.out.println(person.getKey() + " is not a Jedi.");
    }
}
```

This produces the following output:

```
Luke is a Jedi.
Han is not a Jedi.
Chewbacca is not a Jedi.
Yoda is a Jedi.
Leia is a Jedi.
```

## Other methods
This lesson covered many of the primary methods of `Map`s, but it's important to know that there are many other methods that exist to make your job easier. Explore and experiment with the IntelliSense to see what other methods you can discover.

For more information, see the Java documentation for the [Map interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html) and the [HashMap class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) .

# Set

Another unordered data structure is `Set`, a collection that holds unique values. It allows you to quickly determine if the value already exists in the set.

Because `Set`s are unordered, they don't maintain indexes. Items in a `Set` are identified by **hashcodes**. A hashcode is a specially computed value which uniquely identifies each item in the `Set`.

## Creating a new set
Add the required imports to your code:

```java
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashSet;
```

The syntax for creating a set is `Set<T> identifier = new HashSet<T>()`. So if you want to create a `Set` of `String`s, you'd write:

```java
Set<String> names = new HashSet<String>();
```

Like with other collection classes, the type can be any reference data type you want. Here, you create a `Set` that holds `Boolean`s, and another one that holds `Employee`s.

```java
Set<Boolean> schedule = new HashSet<Boolean>();
Set<Employee> reviews = new HashSet<Employee>();
```

## Adding items to the set
The `add()` method adds an element to the `Set`:

```java
Set<String> characters = new HashSet<String>();

characters.add("Luke");    // contains Luke
characters.add("Rey");     // contains Luke, Rey
characters.add("Ben");     // contains Luke, Rey, Ben
characters.add("Luke");    // contains Luke, Rey, Ben
```

The `add()` method returns a `boolean` indicating if the element was added to the `Set`. `false` indicates the element is already present and wasn't re-added.

## Removing items from the set
The `remove()` method removes an element from a `Set`. The method returns a `boolean` indicating if the element was removed:

```java
Set<String> characters = new HashSet<String>();

// ... set contains Luke, Rey, and Ben

characters.remove("Ben");   // set now contains Luke and Rey
```

## Iterating through a set
`Sets` don't have indexes to access each item. To see each of the elements in a `Set`, you'll need to use the foreach loop:

```java
Set<String> characters = new HashSet<String>();

// ... set contains Luke, Rey, and Ben

for (String character : characters) {
    // execute code for each item in the set
}
```

## Other methods
This lesson covered the key methods of `Set`s, but it's important to know that there are many other methods that exist to make your job easier. Explore and experiment with the IntelliSense to see what other methods you can discover.

For more information, see the Java documentation for the [Set interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html) and the [HashSet class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html) .

# Unit summary

You've now learned about `List`s, `Map`s, `Stack`s, `Queue`s, and `Set`s. While these data structures are the ones used most often, there are many, many more.

You may want to explore these data structures further. Key ones to learn more about are:

-   **Linked-Lists** are a foundational data structure, and have many uses directly, or indirectly as part of a larger data structure.
-   **Trees** are often used to maintain a hierarchy of parent, children, and sibling relationships of data, like a file system.
-   **Graphs** show how two different pieces of data are connected. Graphs are often seen in social networking and path-finding/GPS algorithms.

# Quiz

## **Collections (Part 2) - Maps 1**

**A `Map` is:**

â—‹ An unordered collection of objects that have unique values.

â—‹ An ordered collection that has indexes and acts much like an array.

â—‰ An unordered collection of key-value pairs.

â—‹ An ordered collection whose size can't change.

**Explanation:** This is the correct description of a `Map`.


## **Collections (Part 2) - Maps 2**

**True or false: the key and value of a `Map` must be the same data type.**

â—‹ True

â—‰ False

**Explanation:** The key and value can be different data types.


## **Collections (Part 2) - Maps 3**

**Given this `Map` declaration, how do you write a foreach loop to iterate through its elements?**

```java
Map<String, Integer> petAges = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
petAges.put("Mo", 14);
petAges.put("Quill", 12);
petAges.put("Tuxedo", 8);
```

â—‹ `for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> petAge : petAges)`

â—‰ `for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> petAge : petAges.entrySet())`

â—‹ `for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> petAge in petAges)`

â—‹ `for (petAges.entrySet() => Map.Entry<String, Integer> petAge)`

**Explanation:** This is the correct syntax for a foreach loop.


## **Collections (Part 2) - Maps 4**

**What happens when the following code executes?**

```java
Map<String, Integer> animalNumberLegs = new HashMap<>();
animalNumberLegs.put("Dog", 4);
animalNumberLegs.put("Fish", 0);
animalNumberLegs.put("Bear", 2);

animalNumberLegs.put("bear", 4); // Bears actually have 4 legs.

int numberOfLegs = 0;
numberOfLegs = animalNumberLegs.get("Bear");

if (numberOfLegs > 0) {
  Console.WriteLine("Bears have " + numberOfLegs + " legs.");
}
```

â—‹ The number of bear legs isn't displayed on the console.

â—‹ `Bears have 4 legs.` is displayed on the console.

â—‰ `Bears have 2 legs.` is displayed on the console.

â—‹ `Bears have 0 legs.` is displayed on the console.

**Explanation:** Since `Map` keys are case-sensitive, `"bear"` and `"Bear"` are distinct and separate keys. `animalNumberLegs.put("bear",4)` adds a new key-value pair `"bear":4`, while the existing `"Bear"` remains untouched and continues to have a value of `2`.


## **Collections (Part 2) - Maps 5**

**Given the following code, how do you access the key and value of `testScore`?**

```java
Map<String, Integer> testScores = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
testScores.put("Alice", 98);
testScores.put("Bob", 87);
testScores.put("Charlie", 77);

for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> testScore : testScores.entrySet()) {
    System.out.println("Key: " + /*fill in code*/);
    System.out.println("Value: " + /*fill in code*/);
}
```

â—‹ `testScore[0]` and `testScore[1]`

â—‰ `testScore.getKey()` and `testScore.getValue()`

â—‹ `testScore[key]` and `testScore[value]`

â—‹ `testScore.key` and `testScore.value`

**Explanation:** This is the correct syntax for accessing the key and value of a `Map.Entry`.


## **Collections (Part 2) - Maps 6**

**How do you determine if the key "Dave" exists in the given `Map`?**

```java
Map<String, String> people = new HashMap<String, String>();
```

â—‹ `people.getKey("Dave")`

â—‹ `people.hasKey("Dave")`

â—‹ `people.keyExists("Dave")`

â—‰ `people.containsKey("Dave")`

**Explanation:** This is the correct method and way to check for a key's existence.


## **Collections (Part 2) - Maps 7**

**Given this `Map` declaration, what's the return value for `booksYearPublished.remove("The Wonderful Wizard of Oz")`?**

```java
Map<String, Integer> booksYearPublished = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
testScores.put("A Tale of Two Cities", 1859);
testScores.put("The Three Musketeers", 1844);
testScores.put("Childhood's End", 1953);
```

â—‹ `false`

â—‹ `0`

â—‰ `null`

â—‹ An error occurs and the program stops.

**Explanation:** This is the correct value returned for a key that's not in a `Map`. If the key exists, the associated value is returned.
