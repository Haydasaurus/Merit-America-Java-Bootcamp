# Reading from one file while writing to another

Sometimes you need to read from one file and write to another file. This can happen when doing any kind of manipulation of text files, like search and replace.

You can use a `try-with-resoures` block to open the files you need. To do this, separate the files with a semicolon:

```java
try (
    Scanner dataInput = new Scanner(inputFile);
    PrintWriter dataOutput = new PrintWriter(outputFile)
) {
    while(dataInput.hasNextLine()) {
        String lineOfInput = dataInput.nextLine();
        dataOutput.println(lineOfInput.replace("mobile", "cellphone"));
    }
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    System.err.println("Cannot open the file for writing.");
}
```

>**ðŸ›ˆ Warning: Never read and write to the same file**
>
>It might not be obvious, but reading and writing to the same file is a bad idea. While the language might allow you to do it, doing this can cause all sorts of problems and you shouldn't do it.
>
>If you want to change a file directly, say, finding a word and replacing it in the same file, you must instead read from the original file, write to a new empty file and, when you're done and everything is successful, move the new file to the original location to overwrite the original file.
