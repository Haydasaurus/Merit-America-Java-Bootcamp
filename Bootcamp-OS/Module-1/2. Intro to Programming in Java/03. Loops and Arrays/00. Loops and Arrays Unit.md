# Arrays

**Arrays** are a special data type found in almost all programming languages. They make it more convenient to work with values in aggregate rather than a series of individual variables.

## Why are arrays useful?
You've already learned how to create variables and assign values to them. Using what you learned, your first inclination might be to write the following code to calculate the average test score for a group of students:

```java
int aaronScore = 80;
int beaScore = 98;
int billScore = 89;
int greerScore = 70;
int kyleScore = 93;
int margoScore = 84;
int peteScore = 66;
int zedScore = 96;
double averageScore = (aaronScore + beaScore + billScore + greerScore +
                    kyleScore + margoScore + peteScore + zedScore) / 8.0;
```

This works, but it's awkward for several reasons. First, there's a lot of typing. Second, it's difficult to keep everything straight. What if you forgot to include the scores for the two Sams in the class? You could add them to the code like this:

```java
int samScore = 85;
int samScore = 96;
.
.
.
double averageScore = (samScore + samScore + aaronScore + beaScore + billScore + greerScore +
                        kyleScore + margoScore + peteScore + zedScore) / 10.0;
```

However, the second `samScore` causes a "duplicate variable" compiler error. But you're a clever programmer and figure out another way: change the variable names.

```java
int student01 = 85;    // Sam
int student02 = 96;    // Sam
int student03 = 80;    // Aaron
int student04 = 98;    // Bea
int student05 = 89;    // Bill
int student06 = 70;    // Greer
int student07 = 93;    // Kyle
int student08 = 84;    // Margo
int student09 = 66;    // Pete
int student10 = 96;    // Zed
double averageScore = (student01 + student02 + student03 + student04 + student05 +
                    student06 + student07 + student08 + student09 + student10) / 10.0;
```

Then again, 10 students sounds like a small class. A more realistic size is probably 25 or more.

Changing the variable names doesn't address the issue of too much typing or lessen the potential confusion caused by so many variables. Adding 15 more students only exacerbates the problem. Additionally, it's a bad practice to use sequential numbering for naming variables.

Fortunately, there's an alternative: an array.

## Array basics
When you want to work with collections of values, you use arrays. Rather than creating multiple variables, you create a single variable name that can represent multiple values. Instead of worrying whether the test score is Bea's or Sam's (Sam 1 or Sam 2), you interact with the variable as a collection of scores.

### Declaring and initializing an array
Here's the syntax for declaring a new array:

```java
int[] testScores;
```

This command declares a new variable called `testScores`. Its data type is an array of integers.

Once you declare an array, you must initialize it:

```java
testScores = new int[10];
```

You've just initialized the array `testScores` to hold 10 integers.

There are three key points to know when working with arrays:

1.  Arrays represent sequential collections of items. There's a beginning and an end.
2.  All values in the array **_must be the same data type_**.
3.  The size of the array must be defined when initializing the array. Once created, the size is "fixed."

Often, you'll see programmers write those two lines on one statement:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];
```

Arrays aren't limited to integers. You can create arrays to hold any data type:

```java
String[] names = new String[5]; // an array of Strings
boolean[] switches = new boolean[10]; // an array of boolean values
```

If you know the values of your array, you can provide those values at the time of initialization:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[] { 85, 96, 80, 98, 89, 70, 93, 84, 66, 96 };
```

With this code, the compiler counts the number of items provided and uses that for the size of the array.

>int[] testScores = new int[someRandomNumber];

This is the first example of working with a reference type, and in it you're seeing the `new` keyword for the first time. You'll learn more about this, but for now, when you see the `new` keyword, know that it allocates memory to hold your data.

## Elements and indexes
Imagine that you have an array of integers called `testScores`. How do you talk about it?

![An array of test scores](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/163690708-85197e06-da3f-462f-ba58-4990f9e1365b.png)

First, it's important to know that each item inside of an array is called an **element**. The `testScores` array holds 10 elements.

When you want to reference a particular element in a discussion, you refer to it as **"_the element at index X_."** Notice that the first index starts at 0. In programming, counting often starts at 0, so the first element is at index 0.

>ðŸ›ˆ Note: Why zero?
>
>Indexes start with zero because of the way arrays are stored in memory. Think of the variable `testScores` as a reference to a memory block where the array starts. Once you get to that memory block, index 0 means offset 0 blocks from the starting point. Index 1 means offset one block and so on.

Whenever you need to determine the last element in an array, you can use the calculation `length - 1`. Here, the length of the array is 10, so the last index is 9.

### Accessing elements within an array
To access a particular element in an array to read from or assign it to a new value, you can use **index notation**. Enclose the index of the element you're trying to access within a pair of `[]`:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];

testScores[0] = 85; // update the value at index 0 to 85
testScores[1] = 96; // update the value at index 1 to 96
testScores[2] = 80; // update the value at index 2 to 80
testScores[3] = 98; // ...
testScores[4] = 89;
testScores[5] = 70;
testScores[6] = 93;
testScores[7] = 84;
testScores[8] = 66;
testScores[9] = 96;
```

Retrieving a value from an element in the array works like reading the value of a variable, assuming you know the index.

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];

// ... populate array

int aaronsScore = testScores[0];
```

`aaronsScore` now holds a copy of the value stored at index 0 in the `testScores` array.

>ðŸ›ˆ Note: Out of range
>
>Remember that arrays have fixed capacity. If you try to access an item which is beyond the range of the array, an error occurs that causes your program to stop.

## Determining the length of an array
Imagine that you wanted to get the last element in an array:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];

// ... populate the array

int lastValue = testScores[9];
```

You could do this since you know that 9 is the last index in the array. But what if someone changed the size of the array and made it smaller? Your code would trigger an exception because 9 is out of range.

Programmers strive to avoid hard-coding numeric values into their program. Fortunately, there's a formula that calculates the last index at runtime: `length - 1`. Most programming languages provide a way to access this value for a given array.

Each array has a property, `.length`, that allows you to retrieve the size of the given array:

```java
int size = testScores.length;
```

This syntax is often used when referencing the last value:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];

// ... populate the array

int lastValue = testScores[testScores.length - 1];
int secondToLastValue = testScores[testScores.length - 2];
```

Remember how expressions are evaluated? The `length - 1` expression evaluates first and evaluates to 9. That 9 is then used when the program runs to retrieve the actual last value from the array.

# Loops

**Loops** are a fundamental concept for managing program control flow, but they go hand in hand with arrays. Loops provide a convenient way to write a small amount of code that can iterate through all of the values in an array one by one.

One of the things that's best learned with arrays is the concept of loops. Programs that you write can use any of the following control structures during execution:

1.  **A straight line/top-down** - the program runs from top to bottom and every line executes.
2.  **Applying conditional logic** - using `if/else`, the program conditionally executes code based on a condition being true.
3.  **Repetitive code flow** - the program continually executes a block of code as long as a condition remains true.

This lesson covers that last pointâ€”repetitive code flow.

There are three different types of loops used in programming:

-   **for loop** - used when you want code to repeat a defined number of timesâ€”for example, one time for each element in an array.
-   **while loop** - used when you want to continually execute a block of code as long as a condition remains true.
-   **do-while loop** - used when you want to execute a block of code _at least once_ and repeat it as long as a condition remains true.

The most common loop used is the for loop, though for many of the exercises you complete and perform on the job, any of the loop choices can be substituted.

## Writing a for loop
The for loop is defined using the following syntax:

```java
for (<initializer>; <condition>; <iterator>) {
    <body>
}
```

The loop consists of three important pieces:

-   **_initializer_** - the statement (or set of statements) that sets the initial state. This is executed one time _before_ the loop begins.
-   **_condition_** - before running the body of the loop, the expression is evaluated.
-   **_iterator_** - a statement (or set of statements) that executes at the end of each pass through the loop.

The loop continues until the condition evaluates to false.

If you wanted to print "Hello World!" five times using a for loop, it would look like this:

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
```

Here's how the three parts match up:

-   **_initializer_** - `int i = 1;` - declares a local loop variable called `i`. Its initial value is 1, and it's used to track which iteration of the loop you're on.
-   **_condition_** - `i <= 5` - before running the body of the loop, checks to make sure `i` is less than or equal to 5.
-   **_iterator_** - `i++` - after each iteration of the loop, increments the value of `i` by 1. This syntax is equivalent to `i = i + 1`. The condition is then evaluated again and if it remains true, the body executes.

![A for loop animation run step-by-step](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164583111-de7865b3-9b68-462f-9e98-21f7301010cf.gif)

>âœ” Tip: Increment and decrement operators
> 
>There are many different ways to increment a variable:
>
>```java
>i = i + 1;
>i += 1;
>i++;
>```
>
>There is a short-hand syntax for decrementing a variable as well:
>
>```java
>i = i - 1;
>i -= 1;
>i--;
>```

## Looping through an array
If you wanted to create a for loop that iterates through your array of test scores, it might look like this:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];
// ... array is populated

for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
    int value = testScores[i];
}
```

Again, looking at the three parts of the loop:

-   **_initializer_** - `int i = 0;` - `i` tracks which index of the array you're looking at. Since arrays start at index 0, so do you.
-   **_condition_** - `i < testScores.length` - before running the body of the loop, checks to make sure `i` is less than the length of the array to avoid an out of range exception.
-   **_iterator_** - `i++` - after you look at an element at `i`, you want to look at the next one, `i + 1`.

### Calculating the average test score
Using the array of test scores, look at some code that can loop through the array and calculate the average. There are two steps to consider:

1.  Add up the sum of the scores within the array
2.  Divide the sum by the number of scores you're averaging

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10]; // the array

// ... array is populated

int sum = 0; // the sum of all the scores

for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + testScores[i];  // add each score to the sum
}

int average = sum / testScores.length;
```

In this case, you know how big the array is because you still see it. Realistically, you'll write this kind of code within methods where you didn't explicitly create the array.

```java
private int getAverage(int[] testScores) {

    int sum = 0; // the sum of all the scores

    for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
        sum = sum + testScores[i];  // add each score to the sum
    }

    int average = sum / testScores.length;

    return average;
}
```

### Scope
Notice you must declare the `sum` variable outside of the for loop. If you remember from the previous topic, once declared, variables are **_in scope_**. That variable remains in scope until the end of the block when it's discarded and goes **_out of scope_**.

Given that you want your `sum` variable to hold its value, you need to declare it before the loop. Any variable declared within the loop is reinitialized within each iteration of the loop.

## Breaking a loop
If at any point during the loop execution you need it to end without running the remaining iterations, use the `break` statement.

The following code looks through the array of test scores to see if it contains a perfect score:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[10];

// ... array is populated

boolean hasPerfectScore = false;

for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
    if (testScores[i] == 100) {
        hasPerfectScore = true;
        break;      // stop looking for a perfect score if you've found one
    }
}

System.out.println("Contains perfect score " + hasPerfectScore);
```

Unfortunately, there's no way to know if the array contains a perfect score. To be sure, you need to look at every single element in the array. If you find a perfect score before the end of the array, you'd want to stop looking. This is where `break` comes in.

If you don't break, you'd look through the remainder of the array when you don't need to. This is like looking for your keys in every room of your house after you've already found them.

## Skipping a loop
The other statement often used with loops is `continue`. When used inside a loop, the code within the loop body is skipped and continued to the next iteration.

Using the test score example, say you want to calculate the average and not include any zeroes:

```java
int[] testScores = new int[] { 100, 94, 0, 87, 88, 0};

int sum = 0;
int scoreCount = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
    if (testScores[i] == 0) {
        continue;  // don't count zeroes for average
    }
    sum += testScores[i];
    scoreCount++;
}

// sum equal to 369, scoreCount equal to 4
```

When this code is run, only the non-zero scores are counted and added up. The lines after `continue` aren't run when the loop gets to the two zeroes in the array.

# Quiz

## **Loops and Arrays 1**

```java
int x = 2;
int y = 5;
y += x;
```

**What is the value of `y`?**

**Answer:** `7`

**Explanation:** The compound assignment operator `+=` adds the value on the right to the variable on the left.


## **Loops and Arrays 2**

```java
String[] cities = {"Cleveland", "Columbus", "Cincinnati", "Akron", "Dayton"};

String result = cities[3];
```

**What is the value of `result` after this code executes?**

â—‹ Cleveland

â—‹ Columbus

â—‹ Cincinnati

â—‰ Akron

â—‹ Dayton

**Explanation:** "Akron" is the fourth element of the array, which means its index is 3.


## **Loops and Arrays 3**

```java
boolean[] answers = { true, true, false, false };

answers[0] = false;
answers[2] = true;

for(int i = 0; i < answers.length; i++) {
    boolean b = answers[i];
    System.out.print(b + " ");
}
```

**What does the preceding code fragment output?**

â—‹ true true false false

â—‹ true true true false

â—‰ false true true false

â—‹ false true false false

**Explanation:** This output shows that the first and third elements of the `answers` array have been changed.


## **Loops and Arrays 4**

```java
int answer = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if(i % 2 == 0) {
        answer = answer + i;
    }
}
System.out.println(answer);
```

**What value is displayed by this program?**

**Answer:** `20`

**Explanation:** 0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20


## **Loops and Arrays 5**

```java
int sum = 0;
for(int i = 10; i > 0; i -= 3) {
    sum += i;
}
System.out.println(sum);
```

**What value does the preceding fragment display?**

**Answer:** `22`

**Explanation:** 10 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 22


## **Loops and Arrays 6**

```java
1)  int sum = 0;
2)  for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
3)      sum += i;
4)  }
5)  int count = i;
```

**The preceding code fragment causes a compiler error. Which line causes the error?**

â—‹ Line 1

â—‹ Line 2

â—‹ Line 3

â—‹ Line 4

â—‰ Line 5

**Explanation:** This line causes an error because the variable `i` is no longer in scope after the end of the `for` loop where it was declared.


## **Loops and Arrays 7**

Given the following for loop:

```java
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    int sum = 0;
    sum += i;
    System.out.print(sum + " ");
}
```

**What is the printed output of the preceding code?**

â—‹ 10

â—‰ 0 1 2 3 4

â—‹ 0 1 3 6 10

â—‹ 4 3 2 1 0

**Explanation:** `sum` is re-declared and initialized to 0 at the beginning of each iteration of the loop, so it doesn't accumulate a sum. If the intention was to add up all the values of `i`, the declaration of `sum` should be moved before the beginning of the loop.


## **Loops and Arrays 8**

```java
int[] numbers = new int[10];
for(int ix = 0; ix < numbers.length; ix++) {
    numbers[ix] = ix * 2;
}

int result = numbers[3];
```

**What is the value of `result` after this code executes?**

**Answer:** `6`

**Explanation:** After the `for` loop, `numbers` contains `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]`, so `numbers[3]` is six.
