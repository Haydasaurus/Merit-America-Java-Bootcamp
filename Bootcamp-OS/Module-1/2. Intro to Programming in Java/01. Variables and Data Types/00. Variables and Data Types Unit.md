# Variables

Typical programs like web applications need to store and manipulate data. For example, many websites can send a password reset email. Programmers try to write these applications with as little repetitive code as possible.

For example, building a password reset flow for every single user is time consuming. So, to save time, programmers use variables to store the user's email address. This allows them to write their code in a generic and reusable manner.

The next sections address three characteristics of variables:
-   A variable must identify what type of data it stores
-   A variable must be declared before it's used
-   A variable must be given a unique name when it's declared

---

# Data types

Every variable, when created, is defined with a data type. A data type classifies the variable and indicates the type of data that a particular variable holds.

In Java, there are two classifications of data types: primitive data types and reference data types. A primitive data type stores a value like `42`, `true`, or `a`, that consumes a fixed amount of memory. A reference type stores complex data, such as an address book.

## Common data types
Here is a list of the eight primitive data types supported by the Java language:

| Data Type | Range                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `boolean` | `true` or `false`                                        |
| `byte`    | `-128` to `127` or `-2⁷` to `2⁷-1`                       |
| `short`   | `-32,768` to `32,767` or `-2¹⁵` to `2¹⁵-1`               |
| `int`     | `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647` or `-2³¹` to `2³¹-1` |
| `long`    | `-2⁶³` to `2⁶³-1`                                        |
| `float`   | `-3.4` x `10³⁸` to `3.5` x `10³⁸`                        |
| `double`  | `-1.798` x `10³⁰⁸` to `1.798` x `10³⁰⁸`                  |
| `char`    | `\u0000` to `\uffff` ('a', 'b', etc.)                    |

Many of these data types store similar types of data, such as integer, boolean, and floating point. Their difference is in the ranges of values they hold. For example:
-   `int` and `long` both store integers, but `long` can hold significantly larger numbers.
-   `float` and `double` both store decimal points, but `double` offers higher precision.

## Numeric imprecision
There is an infinite number of numeric values, but each primitive data type has a finite number of bits for storing those values. This means primitive data types can't represent every possible number.

For whole numbers like an `int` or `long`, the numbers that can't be represented are those outside the range of possible values for that type.

However, for numbers with a decimal part like a `float` or `double`, the situation is more complex. Not only is there an infinite number of values like `1.0` and `2.0`, but there is also an infinite number of values _between_ them like `1.1`, `1.01`, `1.001`, etc.

Having only a finite number of bits to store these decimal values makes them "imprecise." They're not accurate beyond a certain decimal place. Even though the amount of imprecision may be very small, you must not expect precise results from calculations using imprecise data types in your programs.

For example, adding the `double` values `0.1` and `0.2` results in the value `0.30000000000000004` which is imprecise. It's accurate to 16 decimal places, but the seventeenth place is inaccurate. This could lead to various problems, some of which you can avoid by careful rounding.

However, when numeric precision is critical, you should use a non-primitive, precise data type rather than a `float` or `double`. You'll learn about those data types later.

>**🛈 Note: String data type**
>
>Another common data type is `String`, which is used to store text like `char`, but can be used for more than one character. It isn't a primitive type, so `String` isn't in the list earlier. However, `String` can often be used like a primitive type due to special support in the Java language. You'll learn more details about `String`s later in this course.

# Declaring and using variables

## Declaring a variable
Before using a variable, you must first declare it. The declaration statement for a variable is `data-type identifier;`.

The following code sample shows how to declare several variables:
```java
int numberOfPeople;             // declare an integer called numberOfPeople
double gallonsOfGas;            // declare a double called gallonsOfGas
boolean isRaining;              // declare a boolean called isRaining
char firstLetter;               // declare a char called firstLetter
```

Once you declare a variable within a given scope, you can't declare it again. The following code creates a compilation error:
```java
{
    int numberOfPeople;     // legal

    // ...

    int numberOfPeople;     // numberOfPeople is already in scope and can't be declared again
}
```

## Naming variables
To begin, there are a few Java-specific rules:
-   Variable names must begin with a letter, the dollar sign `$`, or the underscore character `_`. Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscores.
-   Variable names may not be Java keywords, such as `for`, `int`, or `return`. For the complete list of keywords, see [Java Language Keywords](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html) .
-   Variable names are case-sensitive and unlimited in length.

Besides the Java-specific rules, there are many programming conventions. Code that has complex variable names or confusing abbreviations isn't well-received in the developer community. Keeping your variable names clear and consistent benefits your colleagues **_and_** yourself. There's a chance you won't remember what you meant while fixing an error in production on a codebase you worked on over a year ago.

While variable naming is an art, when it comes to creating names, there are some best practices:
-   Follow camel-casing conventions: the first word is lowercase, and subsequent words have the first letter capitalized.
-   Use pronounceable names for variables.
-   Use names over single characters.
-   Avoid creating multiple variables that are variations of the same name, as this creates confusion.
-   Use names that describe **_what_** the variable does, not **_how_** it does it.
-   With booleans, use names that start with is, has, was, and so on. Avoid using a double negative.

**Good Variable Names**
-   `numberOfStudents` for an int
-   `averageCostOfGas` for a double
-   `isAvailable` for a boolean

**Not Good Variable Names**
-   `nbr`
-   `name` followed by `name2`, `name3`, etc.
-   `numberOfStudents` followed by `number_of_students_`

Giving your variables meaningful names is one of the golden rules of programming. Names that clearly describe what the variable does or what information the variable holds will help make your code more readable.

## Assigning values to variables
After you've declared a variable, you can assign it a value. You can assign three different types of values to variables:
-   Literal values, like `42`, `true`, or `a`, depending on the data type
-   Variable values where the value of one variable is given to the value of another variable
-   Evaluated values from an _expression_

You use the assignment operator `=` when giving a value in an assignment statement. In the following code sample, the four variables declared earlier are assigned values:
```java
int numberOfPeople;             // declare an integer called numberOfPeople
double gallonsOfGas;            // declare a double called gallonsOfGas
boolean isRaining;              // declare a boolean called isRaining
boolean isCloudy;               // declare a boolean called isCloudy
char firstLetter;               // declare a char called firstLetter

numberOfPeople = 16;            // assign the integer 16 to the numberOfPeople variable
gallonsOfGas = 3.26;            // assign the double 3.26 to the gallonsOfGas variable
isRaining = true;               // assign the boolean true to the isRaining variable
firstLetter = 'a';              // assign the character 'a' to the firstLetter variable

isCloudy = isRaining;           // copy the value from isRaining into the isCloudy variable
```

If the variable appears on the right-hand side of the operator, then its value is retrieved and copied into the variable on the left-hand side of the operator.

>**✔ Tip: Reading code**
>
>When reading code, it might help to read the right-hand side of the assignment statement first. Once you've determined what value will be used, use the `=` to indicate you are assigning a value to the variable on the left-hand side.

You may often see variables declared **_and_** assigned within the same line of code.

```java
int numberOfPeople = 16;
double gallonsOfGas = 3.26;
boolean isRaining = true;
```

**_Remember that there is a difference between declaring and assigning a value_**.

# Constants

A **constant** is like a variable, except its value can never be changed. In other words, its value is **_constant_**. A constant is useful in programming to make your code more maintainable and readable.

Imagine you have code that calculates the sales tax for a customer's order in the state of California. Sales tax rates don't change that often, so you might decide that the sales tax rate can't be changed while the program runs. So, you declare it a constant:
```java
final double CA_SALES_TAX_RATE = 7.25;
```

Declaring a constant differs from declaring a variable in three ways.

First, you declare constants with the word `final` before the data type. This signals to the compiler that this value is a constant and can't be changed. Your code won't compile if you try to change the value of a constant after it's declared.

Second, you **_must_** assign a value to the constant at the time you declare it. Since the compiler won't allow you to change the value after creating the constant, the value must be set in the declaration.

Third, you write names for constants in all uppercase with underscores separating the words. This signals to other developers that this value is a constant. Your code can compile if the name isn't formatted that way, but it's considered a best practice to do so in Java.

>**🛈 Note: What does immutable mean?**
>
>Constants are often referred to as being **immutable** or having **immutability**. This term means that something can't be changed.
The opposite term is **mutable**, which means something that **_can_** be changed. Variables are mutable.

## Maintainable code
In the sales tax example, imagine that the sales tax rate changed from 7.25% to 7.75%. If your code didn't use a variable or constant for sales tax, you'd have to go through every line of code and replace `7.25` with `7.75`.

This can be a very error-prone process as you might accidentally replace it with the wrong value—like `7.5` instead of `7.75`—or worse, if there was already a typo, you might not find it when you have to change the sales tax. If there's another `7.25` in the code, it might not even be the sales tax and replacing it can break something else.

By defining the sales tax as a constant, you'd only need to change one line of code:
```java
final double CA_SALES_TAX_RATE = 7.75;
```

## Readable code
In the sales tax example, it's clear that `CA_SALES_TAX_RATE` refers to the California sales tax rate. If your code didn't use a variable or constant for sales tax, it might not be clear to another developer what `7.25` refers to.

Consider the following code where two variables, `days` and `seconds`, are declared and used later in an arithmetic expression:
```java
int days = 2;
int seconds = 40;

// many lines of code later...

int numberOfHoursAwake = 24 * days;
int numberOfFrames = 24 * seconds;
```

Although `24` is the same number in both statements, they have different meanings. `24` refers to both the number of hours in a day and the number of frames per second. Reading this code for the first time, you might not know what `24` refers to and might assume they both represent the same thing.

In this example, `24` is a **magic number**. A magic number is a value whose meaning is unknown or is based upon its context.

When writing a program, you're encouraged to use constants instead of magic numbers so other programmers don't have to figure out what `24` means. Using a constant allows you to give the number a name so you can reference it throughout your code.

Using that same idea, consider the following code that uses constants to indicate the meaning of `24`:
```java
int days = 2;
int seconds = 40;
final int NUMBER_OF_HOURS_PER_DAY = 24;
final int NUMBER_OF_FRAMES_PER_SECOND = 24;

// many lines of code later...

int numberOfHoursAwake = NUMBER_OF_HOURS_PER_DAY * days;
int numberOfFrames = NUMBER_OF_FRAMES_PER_SECOND * seconds;
```

Now it's more clear what each statement means and how the variable values are being calculated.

---

# Expressions

You now know a couple ways to assign values to a variable: use literals and other variables. Another way to assign values to a variable is to use an expression. Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that are evaluated and produce a single result, which can then be used in a statement.

An example that you may be familiar with could be this:
```java
200 / 10
```

You know that this arithmetic expression yields a single value: 20. In a program, it could be used in a similar way:
```java
// (200 / 10) is evaluated to 20 which is then saved into the variable.
int milesPerGallon = 200 / 10;
```

The expression on the right side of the `=` assignment operator is fully evaluated to arrive at a single value. Then that value is assigned to the variable that appears to the left of the `=`.

As you continue reading, you'll see many forms of expressions. Next, you'll learn how to use arithmetic expressions with variables in programs.

## Arithmetic expressions
There is usually a need for basic calculations when your programs run. To do that, you have access to the following arithmetic operators.

In the following table, assume A is equal to 15 and B is equal to 2:

| Operator | Description                        | Example    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `+`      | Adds two operands                  | A + B = 17 |
| `-`      | Subtracts two operands             | A - B = 13 |
| `*`      | Multiplies two operands            | A * B = 30 |
| `/`      | Divides two operands               | A / B = 7  |
| `%`      | Finds the remainder after division | A % B = 1  |

### Remainder operator
In the table, one operator you may not have seen before is the **remainder** operator ( `%` ). The result of this operation is the **_remainder_** after integer division. In the example, if the values `15` and `2` are divided, the integer result is `7`, **_with a remainder of `1`_**. This value of `1` is the result of the remainder operation, `15 % 7`.

>**🛈 Note: Other names for the remainder operator**
>
>In other programming languages and generally in computing, the remainder operator may be referred to as the **_modulo_** or **_modulus_** operator. The [Java specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.17.3) calls it **_remainder_**, but you should know that if someone says "modulo", "modulus" or even "mod", they're referring to this operator.

## Compound expressions
The Java programming language allows you to construct compound expressions by combining various smaller expressions. Here's an example of a compound expression:
```java
int result = 2 * 3 * 4;
```

In this example, the order in which the expression is evaluated is unimportant because the result of multiplication is independent of order. `2 * 3` equals `6`, and that result is multiplied by `4`. That expression, `6 * 4`, equals `24`. Likewise, if the second part of the expression is calculated first, `3 * 4` equals `12`, and that result is multiplied by `2`. That expression, `2 * 12`, also equals `24`.

However, in some expressions, the order of evaluation _does_ matter. For example:
```java
2 + 3 * 4
```

That compound expression gives different results, depending on whether you perform the addition or the multiplication operation first. `2 + 3` equals `5`, and `5 * 4` equals `20`. Alternatively, `3 * 4` equals `12`, and `2 + 12` equals `14`.

You can specify exactly how an expression is evaluated using parentheses: `( )`. For example, to make the previous expression unambiguous, you could write the following:
```java
result = (2 + 3) * 4;
```

In this case, the addition operation is performed, and then the result is used in the multiplication operation.

## Operator precedence
If you don't explicitly indicate the order of the operations to be performed, the order is determined by the **_precedence_** of each operator used in the expression. Operators that have a higher precedence are evaluated first. For example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator. Therefore, the following two statements are equivalent:
```java
result = 2 + 3 * 4     // order determined by operator precedence
result = 2 + (3 * 4)   // order explicitly defined by parentheses
```

The arithmetic operators `*`, `/`, and `%` all have **_higher_** precedence than `+` and `-`. In statements with operators of equal precedence, like `*` and `/`, the expressions are evaluated left-to-right.

>**✔ Tip: Use parentheses for readability**
>
>When writing compound expressions, be explicit and indicate with parentheses which operators you want evaluated first with parentheses. This practice makes code easier to read and to maintain.

## Example
The following code sample demonstrates arithmetic operations in the context of several simple expressions and a complex expression:
```java
int a = 15;
int b = 2;
int result;

result = a + b;     // expression is evaluated to 17 and copied into result
result = a - b;     // expression is evaluated to 13 and copied into result
result = a * b;     // expression is evaluated to 30 and copied into result
result = a / b;     // expression is evaluated to 7 and copied into result
result = a % b;     // expression is evaluated to 1 and copied into result

// In the following statement, a is multiplied by b first. The output is divided
// by the current value of the result variable. This final value is assigned
// into the result value.
result = (a * b) / result;

// Translates to
// result = (15 * 2) / result;
// result = 30 / result;
// result = 30 / 1;
// result = 30;
```

>**🛈 Note: String concatenation**
>
>**String concatenation** is the operation of joining two or more strings. For example, the concatenation of `"snow"` and `"ball"` is `"snowball"`.
Concatenation uses the plus sign like adding two numbers together:
>
>```java
>String stringOne = "Hello "; // note the space
>String stringTwo = "World!";
>String stringThree = stringOne + stringTwo; // stringThree will be "Hello World!"
>```

# Type conversion

The numeric data types of Java—like `int`, `long`, and `double`—each have a [range of possible values](https://lms.techelevator.com/cohorts/42/blocks/7/content_files/01_Variables_Data_Types/02-data-types.md#common-data-types). Many values can be expressed as more than one type. For example, the value 23 can be expressed as an `int`, a `long`, or even a `float`. However, you can't use a `long` when the code you're working with requires an `int`.

Most programming languages, including Java, provide the capability to convert a value from one type to another. This is called **type conversion** or **type casting**.

There are two types of conversion operations—widening and narrowing:
-   **Widening** means converting a smaller data type, like `int`, to a larger data type, such as `long`.
-   **Narrowing** means converting a larger data type, like `long`, to a smaller data type, such as `int`.

## Widening
A `long` has a larger range of values than an `int` does, so any `int` value can be used in a `long`. Similarly, `double` has a larger range of values than `float`, so any `float` can be used in a `double`. These are considered **widening** operations.

The Java numeric data types are widened in the following order:
```java
byte > short > int > long > float > double
```

Widening conversions happen **_implicitly_**. In other words, the conversion happens automatically. You assign the smaller data type value to the larger data type:
```java
short shortValue = 23;
long longValue = shortValue;
```

## Narrowing
The opposite of a widening conversion is a **narrowing** conversion. Narrowing conversions occur when you assign a larger data type value to a smaller data type value—for example, assigning a `long` value to an `int`.

The Java numeric data types can be narrowed in the reverse order of widening conversions:
```java
double > float > long > int > short > byte
```

Narrowing conversions happen **_explicitly_**. That means you need to write code to convert a value. To convert a value, you use this syntax:
```java
(dataTypeToConvertTo)valueToConvert;
```

For example, converting a `long` to a `short` looks like this:
```java
long longValue = 23;
short shortValue = (short)longValue;
```

If you don't use that format for a narrowing conversion, your code won't compile. Instead, the compiler returns an error message about a possible loss of value:
```
error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from long to short
```

### Loss of value - overflow
If you convert a larger value to a smaller data type—even with explicit conversion—there might be an issue if the value is too big for the data type.

Recall that the data type `byte` can only handle values between `-128` and `127`. What happens if you try to cast a value too large for it?

```java
int intValue = 132;
byte byteValue = (byte)intValue;
```

After running this code, `byteValue` has a value of `-124`. What happened here?

This is called an **overflow**. When a data type overflows, it "rolls over" to the minimum value, and the remainder value is added to it. This is the "possible lossy conversion" that the compiler warns about.

Imagine `intValue` is `126`, is incremented by `1` six times, and converted to a `byte` after each increment. This table shows the value of `intValue` and `byteValue` at each step:

| intValue | byteValue |
| -------- | --------- |
| 126      | 126       |
| 127      | 127       |
| 128      | -128      |
| 129      | -127      |
| 130      | -126      |
| 131      | -125      |
| 132      | -124      |

After `byteValue` is `127`, its next incremented value is `-128` because it rolled over to its minimum value, and then begins incrementing from there.

### Loss of value - truncation
You can also experience a loss of value if you convert from a decimal value, like `float` or `double`, to an integer value, like `int` or `long`:
```
double doubleValue = 99.9;
int intValue = (int)doubleValue;
```

After running this code, `intValue` has a value of `99`. Notice that it's not `100`. Converting to an integer value drops the numbers after the decimal point, and it doesn't round the value to the nearest integer.

However, if you convert from a `double` that has more decimal places than a `float` can handle, it **_does_** round the `float` value:
```java
double doubleValue = 99.99999;
float floatValue = (float)doubleValue;
// floatValue is 99.99999

doubleValue = 99.999999; // one additional decimal place
floatValue = (float)doubleValue;
// floatValue is 100
```

## Inferring data types
One final point to know about type conversion occurs when you perform arithmetic between two data types. Depending on the data types used in your math, you may end up with a different value than expected.

Imagine you have a program that calculates the average of test scores:
```java
int score1 = 85;
int score2 = 93;
int score3 = 75;
int score4 = 90;
int sum = score1 + score2 + score3 + score4;
// sum is 343
```

An average is calculated by adding all the values together and dividing that by the number of values. The average test score is 343 divided by 4, or 85.75.

If you divide the integer `343` by the integer `4`, you get `85.0`:
```java
double averageScore = sum / 4;
// averageScore is 85.0
```

This is because the compiler uses the data types on the right-hand side to determine the value to assign, even though it's being assigned to a `double`. It truncated the decimal value and converted it to an integer because the expression contained only integers.

If you performed that same calculation with the `double` value of `4.0`, you'll receive the correct average:
```java
double averageScore = sum / 4.0;
// averageScore is 85.75
```

You can also convert the `4` to a `double` for the same result:
```java
double averageScore = sum / (double)4;
// averageScore is 85.75
```

In both of the examples, the `double` value on the right-hand side causes the compiler to correctly return a `double` value.

## Literal suffixes
Literal values in Java have default data types. A literal number without a decimal part is an `int`, and a literal number with a decimal part is a `double`. For example:
```java
daysInWeek = 7; // 7 is an int
milesInMarathon = 26.2; // 26.2 is a double
```

To make a literal number a `float` or a `long`, add a **literal suffix**. The suffix `F` makes the number a `float`, and the suffix `L` makes the number a `long`. For example:
```java
normalTemp = 98.6F; // 98.6 is a float
populationIn2020 = 7800000000L; // 7,800,000,000 is a long
```

Lowercase `f` and `l` are also valid, but avoid `l` because it looks like the number one.

Use literal suffixes to avoid compiler errors due to the default data types. For example:
```java
//float f = 3.26;  // won't compile because a float variable can't contain a double value
float f = 3.26F;   // adding F makes 3.26 a float value

//long total = 5000000000;  // won't compile because 5 billion is too large to be an int
long total = 5000000000L;   // adding L makes 5 billion a long value
```
