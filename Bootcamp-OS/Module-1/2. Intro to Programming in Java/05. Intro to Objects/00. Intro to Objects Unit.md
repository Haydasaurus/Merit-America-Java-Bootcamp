# What's an object?

## Layers of abstraction
You've learned that when you write programs, you need to break your solutions down into step-by-step actions to solve problems. If you need to find the largest number in an array, you might write something like this:

```java
int largestElement = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < arrayOfNumbers.length; i++) {
    if (arrayOfNumbers[i] > largestElement) {
        largestElement = arrayOfNumbers[i];
    }
}
// largestElement will have the largest number from the array
```

You've looked at problems like this, as well as methods that let you encapsulate that code into something reusable:

```java
public int getLargestElement(int[] arrayOfNumbers) {
    int largestElement = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arrayOfNumbers.length; i++) {
        if (arrayOfNumbers[i] > largestElement) {
            largestElement = arrayOfNumbers[i];
        }
    }
    return largestElement;
}

int largestFromFirst = getLargestElement(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5});
// largestFromFirst == 5
int largestFromSecond = getLargestElement(new int[] {300, 240, 550, 129});
// largestFromSecond == 550
```

Grouping this code into a method makes it possible to reuse it rather than rewriting it. Being able to reuse methods helps to save time and helps you write more readable code.

It also means that you can work at a higher layer of abstraction. Putting the algorithm for finding the largest number inside of a method helps to solve more complex problems with less and more obvious code:

```java
public boolean isLargestElementEven(int[] arrayOfNumbers) {
    return getLargestElement(arrayOfNumbers) % 2 == 0;
}
```

The question that remains now is: if methods are good, are more methods better?

## Objects
**Object-Oriented Programming** is about organizing your problem-solving into objects. An **object** is an in-memory data structure that combines state and behavior into a usable and useful abstraction. In other words, objects are a collection of variables and methods.

Objects have many benefits:

1.  **They're modular**
    
    Breaking your programming into objects allows you to section off your code into pieces. You can treat each of these pieces as a mini-program that you can test and write separately from other parts of your application. This allows you to think about and plan each part of the whole.
    
2.  **They hide information**
    
    Most people frown upon hidden information, but in programming, it's a good thing. Objects are used by calling their methods, and other parts of the program that use the object don't know, or need to know, how the object's methods are actually coded.
    
    It doesn't matter how `getLargestNumber()` is implemented. What matters is that it produces the largest number. In fact, you might find a much faster algorithm that solves `getLargestNumber()` and can replace all the code in it whenever you want. As long as it takes an `int[]` and returns a `int`, you can change the code within that method all day long.
    
3.  **They allow you to reuse code**
    
    If you build your code using objects, reusing that code becomes straightforward—just create another object. Objects are built to be modular and handle one small function of your application, which makes them useful for many different purposes.
    
4.  **They're pluggable and testable**

    Because the objects are accessible through very defined methods, testing the object is a matter of calling those methods and making sure they're doing what you expect them to do. You can also swap out one object for another in your application. To do so, write another object that has the same method signatures. Then, you have a drop-in replacement for what was already there.
    

For these reasons and more, programming with objects, or object-oriented programming—is a smart idea when building a complex program in Java.

## What's a class?
So, how do you make an object? Technically, you don't write objects in your code. Objects only exist when your code is running because an object is an in-memory data structure. To make objects, you must write classes.

A **class** is a grouping of variables and methods in a source code file, from which objects can be created. It's important to know what a class is before you begin writing classes and using objects.

A class is to an object like a blueprint is to a house. A class defines the features of the objects created as instances of that class.

![Blueprints and Houses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164613319-d976d395-dec0-44db-bf5b-8eb527e5461a.png)

Imagine a blueprint that specifies the location of a bathtub. You can't take a shower in that tub because it's a drawing on a piece of paper. But if you build a house out of that blueprint, you can use the tub whenever you want.

In fact, you can build as many houses as you want from that blueprint, and each has its own shower. It's important that each house has its own bathtub and not share the same one between them.

The same is true for objects. Imagine that you have a class in your code that models a Person. This `Person` class has a variable to hold a first name and a last name.

```java
class Person {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;
}
```

That's your blueprint. You've created a class that defines two variables in it. But it's not an object just yet; it's a blueprint for one. To create an object from it, there are a few steps to complete.

## Creating objects
Creating a new object involves three pieces of code. They're usually, but not always, contained in the same statement.

1.  Declaration - A declaration associates a new variable name with a defined data type. You've seen this before when working with variables.
2.  Instantiation - Using `new` creates a new object in memory and returns the address to it. You've seen `new` with arrays before, and here it's doing the same thing—making a new object for you to use.
3.  Initialization - Using a constructor sets some initial values on the created object's instance variables. Essentially, it starts an object off with a certain state.

The following example shows these three pieces at work:

```java
                            // Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Siding
House houseAt443WinstonSt = new House(3, 2.5, "Cornflower Blue");
```

This line creates a new `House` object and stores a reference to that new in-memory object into the variable `houseAt443WinstonSt`. The following section summarizes each piece:

-   **Declaration**: `House houseAt443WinstonSt` is the declaration. It creates a variable called `houseAt443WinstonSt` that holds a reference to a `House` object. The data type of the `houseAt443WinstonSt` variable is `House`.
    
-   **Instantiation**: `new House()` is the instantiation. This creates a new **_instance_** of a House in heap memory from the class `House` and then returns the address of that memory location to save it in a variable.
    
-   **Initialization**: `House(3, 2.5, "Cornflower Blue")` is the initialization. This starts the object off with some initial values in its instance variables. This creates the object, sets its values, and gets it ready for use right away.
    

These three pieces make up one common statement: the creation and initialization of a new object and storing a reference to it in a variable so it can be accessed.

# Objects in memory

One important thing to understand about objects is how they're stored in memory. Usually, you wouldn't need to dive down into the hardware and see **_how_** things are working, but for objects, especially in Java, this can be important.

First, you'll learn about the Stack.

## The Stack
When an application runs, there is a memory space set up for it called the Stack. **The Stack** is a set amount of memory that stores some of the basic values. When you create a new `int`, the system knows to reserve exactly 4 bytes, or 32 bits, of space for it. So if you say:

```java
int a = 0;
```

Then the system creates a 4-byte spot in the Stack, calls it `a`, and stores the value of 0 in it.

If you call:

```java
double price = 5.23;
```

Then the system creates an 8-byte spot in the Stack, calls it `price`, and stores 5.23 in it. This happens on the Stack because you know the exact size of the variables.

For all primitive values, this works well. You know exactly what size primitive values are, or can be, so these can be stored on the Stack all day long. But what about this line of code?

```java
int[] numbers;
```

How big can `numbers` be? You know `int`s are 4 bytes each, but you don't know how many `ints` are in `numbers`. So, arrays can't be stored on the Stack. You have to store them in a different, more dynamic memory structure. That structure is called the Heap.

## The Heap
**The Heap** is the memory space where arrays and objects go.

In the previous example, you declared a variable to hold an `int[]`. This variable is still created in the Stack, but the array itself is created in the Heap.

```java
int[] numbers = new int[10];
```

You know it's in the Heap because of the `new` operator. That's the operator that reserves a new hunk of memory on the Heap.

So, the array is created on the Heap and then the **_memory address_** of it is stored in the variable `numbers` on the Stack. When you use the variable `numbers` in your code, it holds a memory address only. Then you access the array in the Heap using either the dot operator (`.`) or brackets (`[]`).

So all variables live on the Stack, but their values might not.

## So what?
Data types that keep their values on the Stack, like `int` and `double`, are called primitives or value types.

Data types that keep their values on the Heap, like arrays and objects, are called reference types.

So what does this mean for you? Look at the following lines of code:

```java
int a = 10;
int b = a;
b = 4;
```

What value is stored in `a` after you run that last line of code? If you understand that these variables hold values, you should be able to figure out that `a` is still `10`. You set `a` to `10`. You then set `b` to the same value that's in `a`. So now, `b` is `10`. Then you set `b` to `4`. The value of `a` doesn't change and is still `10`.

Look at the following code:

```java
int[] a = new int[] {10, 20, 30};
int[] b = a;
b[0] = 100;
```

Now, what's the value stored in `a`? Would you believe `[100, 20, 30]`?

To understand this, you need to understand how `=` works.

The `=` takes the value from one variable and stores it into another variable. For reference variables, the value stored in the variable is a memory address and that memory address transfers to the new variable.

In the previous block of code, you declare a new variable called `a` that contains the address to an `int[]`. You then create a new `int[]` on the Heap and store its address into `a`.

Next, you put that same address from `a` into the declared variable `b`. These two variables now point to the exact same `int[]` in the Heap. The `=` didn't copy the array; it just took the address from `a` and put it into `b`.

That last line, `b[0] = 100`, does something interesting. When your language sees a dot (`.`) or a bracket (`[`)—also called dereference operators—it checks the address in the variable. Then, it jumps over that location in the Heap and goes to the array or object that's stored over there.

So, `b[0]` jumps the code over to the Heap and checks the first element in the array over there. You then say `b[0] = 100`, which sets that element's value to `100`.

So, the array that `a` points to did change. This is because `a` and `b` now point to the same array in the Heap. A change using one variable shows up in the other variable too.

It's important to remember if you're using a value type (primitives) or a reference type (arrays and objects) in your code.

## Object equality
Typically, when you wanted to see if two variables are equal, you used the `==` operator. However, `==` works on the **_value_** of the variable. It behaves differently depending upon whether the variable is a value type or a reference type.

For value types, `==` checks to see if the two values stored in the variables are the same.

For reference types, `==` checks to see if the two variables hold the same address. This may not be what you want. In fact, it's often not what you want at all.

The following are some examples using strings, which are objects, and therefore, reference types in Java:

```java
String lowerCaseName = new String("java");
String anotherName = lowerCaseName;
lowerCaseName == anotherName;
```

Does `lowerCaseName == anotherName` return true? Yes, it does. Both of those variables hold the same address, so `==` returns true here. What about the following example?

```java
String lowerCaseName = new String("java");
String anotherName = new String("java");
lowerCaseName == anotherName;
```

Now does `lowerCaseName == anotherName` return true? You can see that the two objects contain the same word **_but they aren't the same object_**. So `==` returns false here. Remember, when working with objects, `==` compares the addresses of the objects, and these two variables point to two different objects in memory.

If you don't want to compare addresses but want to compare the **_contents_** of two objects, you need to use something other than `==`. Thankfully, Java has a standard method that lets you do that. If you want to compare two objects to see if they're equivalent, you use the `.equals()` method of the object:

```java
String lowerCaseName = new String("java");
String anotherName = new String("java");
lowerCaseName.equals(anotherName);
```

`.equals()` checks if these two possibly different objects are equivalent. For objects, this is a kind of equivalence you want to check.

>**✔ Tip: Ask the right equivalence**
>
>For value types (primitives), use the `==` operator to check if two things are equal.

For objects, use the `.equals()` operator to check if two things are equal.

## Null reference
Can you have a reference variable that doesn't reference anything? Recall this code from earlier in this lesson:

```java
int[] numbers;
```

This line of code only completes the first step of the three-step declare-instantiate-initialize creation process. The variable of type `int[]` has been declared, so it exists on the Stack. But `new` hasn't been called, so there's no Heap memory allocated, and therefore no address to store in `numbers`.

So what's in `numbers`? When a reference variable isn't referencing an object, the variable holds the special value `null`. This is also known as a **_null reference_**. You can test whether a variable isn't currently referencing an object using this value:

```java
if (numbers == null) {
    // Tell the user numbers is invalid.
}
```

Likewise, you can assign `null` to any reference variable to "clear" the variable. Suppose your program is done with the array and no longer needs access to it. This code clears the variable and allows the memory to be reused:

```java
// Remove the reference to memory
numbers = null;
```

When a reference variable is null, your code can't de-reference the variable. That is, it can't use the `.` or `[]` operators to access the memory it's pointing to. If you try this, your program receives an error.

# Strings

The first object to discuss is objects from the `String` class. To create a new `String` object, use the `"` syntax.

```java
String myName = "Xiang";
```

Earlier, you learned that new objects are created with the `new` keyword, but strings are special because they're frequently used. So, Java allows you to create new `String` objects with the `"` literal.

In the previous example, the code creates a new `String` object with the contents of `"Xiang"` on the Heap and assigns its address to the newly declared `myName` variable.

The `myName` variable now acts like a handle on the actual object. You can access the object's methods by using the dot `(.)` operator.

```java
int lengthOfTheString = myName.length();
```

There are other useful methods to look at for strings.

## Length
`length()` returns the number of characters in the string:

```java
String name = "Alexi";
int lengthOfName = name.length(); // lengthOfName is set to 5
```

## Substring
The `substring()` method gets a small subset of an existing string. The parameters are:

1.  The index to start the substring.
2.  An optional index to end the substring. If not given, it goes to the end of the string.

```java
String fullName = "Jaylen Jones";
String firstName = fullName.substring(0, 6); // <- Will equal "Jaylen"
String lastName = fullName.substring(7); // <- Will equal "Jones"
```

## Contains
The `contains()` method checks if a string contains another string. The parameter is the string to search for:

```java
String fullName = "Jaylen Jones";
boolean hasJaylenInIt = fullName.contains("Jaylen"); // Will equal true
```

## Starting and ending
The `startsWith()` and `endsWith()` methods work like the `contains()` method, but they only check if the string starts or ends with the given parameter:

```java
String fullName = "Jaylen Jones";
boolean endsWithJones = fullName.endsWith("Jones"); // Will equal true
```

## Index of
The `indexOf()` method looks through a string, finds the first occurrence of another string. It returns the index the string was found at, or `-1` if it's not found:

```java
String name = "Jaylen Jones";
int firstJFound = name.indexOf("J"); // Will return 0
int firstLetterOfJones = name.indexOf("Jones"); // Will return 7
int firstSmithFound = name.indexOf("Smith"); // Will return -1
```

## Replace
The `replace()` method returns a new string where all occurrences of a given string are replaced with another string:

```java
String name = "Jaylen Jones";
String nameWithReplacements = name.replace("Jaylen", "Jordan");
    // nameWithReplacements will equal "Jordan Jones"
    // name will still equal "Jaylen Jones"
```

>**🛈 Note: Immutability**
>
>`String` objects are immutable. Immutable means that it's impossible to change its value once it's created. Using the `replace()` method always creates a new `String` object.

## Comparing two strings
`equals()` and `equalsIgnoreCase()` are two methods that compare the current `String` object to a `String` object parameter and return true or false. `equals()` only returns true if the characters are exactly the same. `equalsIgnoreCase()` ignores whether a letter is upper or lower case:

```java
String name = "Jaylen";
String otherName = "jaylen";
boolean isExactlyTheSame = name.equals(otherName); // Will be false
boolean isCloseToTheSame = name.equalsIgnoreCase(otherName); // Will be true
```

## Splitting and joining strings
`split()` and `String.join()` are two methods, one that turns a string into an array, and one that turns an array of strings back into a single string.

Both of these methods use a delimiter, which is a character or set of characters that mark different sections of a string:

```java
String fullString = "Chandra;Lakshmi;Madhu;Sri";
String[] separateNames = fullString.split(";");
    // separateNames will contain ["Chandra", "Lakshmi", "Madhu", "Sri"]
String togetherNames = String.join(",", separateNames);
    // togetherNames will equal "Chandra,Lakshmi,Madhu,Sri"
```

## Converting to lower and upper case
`toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()` return a new string with the contents lower or upper-cased:

```java
String name = "jOse";
String lowered = name.toLowerCase(); // Will be "jose"
String uppered = name.toUpperCase(); // Will be "JOSE"
```

# Quiz

## **Intro to Objects (Strings) 1**

**Which of the following declaration statements create a reference type? (Check all that are correct.)**

	Select all correct options

□ `int` x = `5`;

□ `boolean` isOn = `true`;

■ `String` message = `"Hello"`;

■ `int[]` scores = new `int[5]`;

**Explanation:** Arrays and `String` objects are both reference types, while `int` and `boolean` are primitive types.


## **Intro to Objects (Strings) 2**

**What keyword do you use to create an instance of a class?**

**Answer:** `new`

**Explanation:** Using `new` creates a new object in memory and returns the address to it.


## **Intro to Objects (Strings) 3**

**When a reference variable doesn't point to an object, its value is (               ).**

**Answer:** `null`

**Explanation:** When a variable holds the special value `null`, it's also known as a **_null reference_**.


## **Intro to Objects (Strings) 4**

**You can't change the value of a string.**

◉ True

○ False

**Explanation:** `String` objects are immutable.


## **Intro to Objects (Strings) 5**

**What is the output of this code snippet?**

```java
String s1 = "ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL";
String s2 = s1.substring(16, 19);

System.out.println(s2);
```

**Answer:** `TED`

**Explanation:** The `substring()` method's first parameter is the index of the character to begin with and the second parameter is the index to copy up to (but not including), so characters 16-18 ("TED") are copied to `s2`.


## **Intro to Objects (Strings) 6**

**What is the value of the `areEqual` variable after this code executes?**

```java
char[] awesomeArray = new char[] { 'A', 'w', 'e', 's', 'o', 'm', 'e' };

String awesomeString1 = new String(awesomeArray);
String awesomeString2 = new String(awesomeArray);

boolean areEqual = awesomeString1 == awesomeString2;
```

○ `true`

◉ `false`

**Explanation:** The strings referenced by `awesomeString1` and `awesomeString2` contain the same characters, but they're stored in different locations on the Heap. To check if two strings contain the same characters, use `.equals()`.


## **Intro to Objects (Strings) 7**

**If the variable `myString` refers to the string "New York, New York", what value does `myString.indexOf("new")` return?**

○ `0`

○ `1`

○ `10`

◉ `-1`

**Explanation:** `myString` does not contain `"new"` (`"new"` and `"New"` do not match) so `myString.indexOf("new")` returns `-1`.


## **Intro to Objects (Strings) 8**

**If the variable `myString` references the string "This is a test", which of the following method calls return `true`?**

	Select all correct options

■ `myString.substring(9).contains("t")`

□ `myString.substring(9).startsWith("t")`

■ `myString.substring(9).endsWith("t")`

□ `myString.substring(9).equals("t")`

**Explanation:** `myString.substring(9)` is `" test"` which contains `"t"` and ends with `"t"`.


## **Intro to Objects (Strings) 9**

**What is the output of this code snippet?**

```java
String space = " ";
String[] pets = {"guinea pig", "cat", "dog"};
String joinedPets = String.join(space, pets);
pets = joinedPets.split(space);

System.out.println(pets[2]);
```

○ guinea pig

◉ cat

○ dog

**Explanation:** After the call to `split()`, the `pets` array contains `{"guinea", "pig", "cat", "dog"}` so "cat" is printed out.


## **Intro to Objects (Strings) 10**

**What is the output of this code snippet?**

```java
String city = "Kansas City, Kansas";
city.replace("Kansas", "New York");

System.out.println(city);
```

◉ Kansas City, Kansas

○ New York City, Kansas

○ Kansas City, New York

○ New York City, New York

**Explanation:** The `replace()` method returns a new string with the replacements (but nothing was done with that returned string in this snippet). The original string is unchanged, so "Kansas City, Kansas" is the output.
