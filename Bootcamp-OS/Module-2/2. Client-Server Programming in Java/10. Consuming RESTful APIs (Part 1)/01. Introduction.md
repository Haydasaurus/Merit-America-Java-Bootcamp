# Introduction

So far you've learned about the HTTP protocol and how requests are made. Now you'll learn how to make HTTP requests in your code and how to handle the data you get back.

To interact with web services, you need a way to send HTTP requests and process the results. This is usually accomplished using a class or library that provides a "client" to make the requests and methods to read the response from the server.

In this unit, you'll continue to use Spring framework libraries to assist you. In this case, you'll use the Spring REST Client [RestTemplate](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#rest-resttemplate) . It's available through Java's dependency management platform called Maven. The code that you'll work with has `RestTemplate` installed already.
