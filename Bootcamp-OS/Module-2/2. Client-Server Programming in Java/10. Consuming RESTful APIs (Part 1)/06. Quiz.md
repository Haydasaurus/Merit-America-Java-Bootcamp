# Quiz

## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 1**

**What does it mean to "consume an API?"**

○ Use an API too much

○ Register for an account to use an API

◉ Interact with an API in code

○ Include the Spring REST client in your Java project

**Explanation:** Interacting with an API, typically using a REST client like Spring's `RestTemplate`, is called "consuming an API."


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 2**

**What does a deserializer do?**

	Select all correct options

□ Sends an HTTP request

■ Creates an object

□ Replaces the JSON string with a modified JSON string

■ Sets the values of properties with matching names

**Explanation:** A deserializer converts a JSON string into an object. It creates the new object and sets the values of its properties with names that correspond to properties in the JSON.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 3**

**How would you determine that `RestTemplate` received a response status code in the 400-599 range that indicates an error?**

◉ `RestTemplate` throws an exception

○ `getForObject()` returns null

○ The response status code stored in `RestTemplate` is in that range

○ Deserializing the JSON fails

**Explanation:** If a request isn't successful, `RestTemplate` throws an exception.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 4**

**How can you have the `getObject()` method of `RestTemplate` return an object of type `Person`?**

○ By assigning the result to a variable of type `Person`

◉ By specifying `Person.class` as a parameter

○ By specifying `Person` as a parameter

○ By casting the result as a `Person`

**Explanation:** The `getObject()` method needs a `Class` object to determine what type of object to create and return. The quickest way to get the `Class` object for any class is to add `.class` to the name of a class (like `Person.class`). That's called a "class literal."


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 5**

**True or False: In order to deserialize JSON into an object, all the properties present in the JSON must also be present in the object.**

○ True

◉ False

**Explanation:** Only properties with matching names have their values set. Other properties are ignored.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 6**

**What's the output of this program if the JSON string returned by the API endpoint `http://localhost:3000/snacks/1` is `{"snack_name": "Potato Crisps", "slot": "A1"}`?**

```java
//---Snack.java---
public class Snack {
    @JsonProperty("slot")
    private String position = "";

    private String name = "";

    // Assume standard getters and setters.
}

//---Example.java---
public static void main(String[] args) {
    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    Snack snack =
        restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:3000/snacks/1", Snack.class);
    System.out.println("Snack: " + snack.getName());
    System.out.println("Position: " + snack.getPosition());
}
```

○
```shell
Snack: Potato Crisps  
Position: A1
```

○
```shell
Snack: Potato Crisps  
Position:
```

◉
```shell
Snack:  
Position: A1
```

○
```shell
Snack:  
Position:
```

**Explanation:** Since `snack_name` doesn't match `name` that property isn't set.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 7**

**If this JSON was returned by the API endpoint `http://localhost:3000/snacks`, which one of these lines of code would be correct?**

```json
[
    {"snack_name": "Potato Crisps", "slot": "A1"},
    {"snack_name": "Stackers", "slot": "A2"},
    {"snack_name": "Grain Waves", "slot": "A3"}
]
```

○ `Snack snacks = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:3000/snacks", Snack.class);`

○ `Snack[] snacks = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:3000/snacks", Snack.class);`

○ `Snack snacks = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:3000/snacks", Snack[].class);`

◉ `Snack[] snacks = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:3000/snacks", Snack[].class);`

**Explanation:** The JSON contains an array. `Snack[].class` is the class literal for an array of `Snack` objects, so that's what the call to `getObject()` returns.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 8**

**What order do the following events happen in when your code calls an API with the `getObject()` method of `RestTemplate`?**

▤ An HTTP GET request is sent

▤ An HTTP response is received

▤ `RestTemplate` may throw an exception based on the response status code

▤ The deserializer creates a new object

▤ The deserializer sets values for properties with matching names

▤ `getObject()` returns an object to your code
