# Introduction

Recently you've learned how to create web APIs in a server application and how to consume those methods in a client application. As you saw with the API methods you wrote, you can provide ways to add, edit, and delete information.

In the real world, APIs may even retrieve and return sensitive information. How can you secure these API methods on the server? How would you access the API in a client application?

The answer to those questions is authentication and authorization. While they're similar sounding words and both are related to security, they're different terms.

## What's authentication? What's authorization?

**Authentication** is the process of validating that users are who they claim to be. Passwords are the most common authentication factor. If a user enters the correct username and password, the system assumes the identity is valid and grants access.

**Authorization** is the process of giving a user permission to access a specific resource or function. For example, Alice may see and update salaries, but Bob may only see them.

## Forms of authentication

There are three distinct categories of authentication factors:

-   **Knowledge factors** are something the user _knows_. Examples: passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), and security questions such as "What is your mother's maiden name?"
-   **Ownership factors** are something the user _has_. Examples: physical USB security keys, and cell phones receiving one-time codes through text messages (SMS) or authentication apps like Google Authenticator.
-   **Inherence factors** are something the user _is_ or _does_. Examples: fingerprints, face scan, voice, signature, retinal pattern.

Software applications can use any factor to identify a user. You're already familiar with entering a password to access your computer, or nearly any website. Some applications may require you to enter a code you received on your phone. This is **two-factor authentication** (2FA) or **multi-factor authentication** (MFA).

Once a user authenticates themselves with your application, how do you continue to verify their identity? If you recall from a previous lesson, HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means the server can't tell if any two requests are from the same client. Because of that, each request must contain information about the user's identity.

# JSON Web Token

The **JSON Web Token** (JWT) is a compact method of securely transmitting information between parties. When decoded, this information is a JSON object. JWTs can be used for transmitting nearly any data, but they're used primarily for authorization in APIs and other HTTP requests. JWTs are ideal because of their small size, and being an open standard, anyone can implement code to read and write JWTs.

When a user authenticates with an application that uses JWTs, the server creates the token and returns it to the client in the response:

```json
{
  "id": 23,
  "username": "dave",
  "role": "admin",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIyMyIsIm5hbWUiOiJkYXZlIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNTkwNzgwNTcwLCJleHAiOjE1OTEzODUzNzB9.k-8tPLjLqzcaNz7yuFpCsOQlic2NofJ-BSu-EkdmW7Q"
}
```

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Example is for illustrative purposes**
>
>The information you receive from another developer's API may have different names or contain other data.

Now that the client has the token, it must include that token in every API request that requires authorization. The JWT token goes in the `Authorization` HTTP header with the word `Bearer`. This indicates the type of authentication:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIyMyIsIm5hbWUiOiJkYXZlIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNTkwNzgwNTcwLCJleHAiOjE1OTEzODUzNzB9.k-8tPLjLqzcaNz7yuFpCsOQlic2NofJ-BSu-EkdmW7Q
```

When the server receives the request, it verifies the accuracy of the JWT and allows access to the resource if the user is authorized for it.

## Decoding JWTs

So far you've only seen JWTs in their encoded form. It's difficult to debug or diagnose an issue with a JWT in this format. However, as long as the token isn't encrypted, it's possible to decode the JWT to view the contents.

There are a number of tools online to decode a JWT, but one of the most popular is [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) . When you open the site, they pre-populate a sample token. Start by looking at their sample token and the decoded data:

![JWT io sample token](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176076075-212f9f30-74e4-4349-b3de-7c67d6de7b26.png)

If you look in the "decoded" side, there are three components to a JWT: header, payload (data), and signature:

-   The **header** provides information about the token itself. Typically, it only contains the algorithm (`alg`) used to sign, and the type (`typ`) of token, which is usually "JWT", but the standard allows for other types of tokens in the future.
-   The **payload** is the actual data of the token, which are also called claims. **Claims** are statements about an entity, such as a user, and additional data, such as the time the token was issued or expires. You can add custom claims, as you'll see in the next example.
-   The **signature** is verification that the data hasn't been tampered with. The server creates the signature by encoding the header and payload, combining it with a "secret"â€”typically only known by the serverâ€”and creating a hash based on the algorithm defined in the header. Since the secret is only known by the server, the server is the only one that can verify tokens and create new ones.

With the color-coded representation of the JWT, you can see that even when it's in encoded form, you can still see the three distinct parts of the token. Tokens are always in a `header.payload.signature` format.

## Claims

As stated before, claims are statements about an entity, typically a user. While most of the JWT standard is strict, you have some flexibility on the data stored in the payload section, though you want to keep the token small so it transmits quickly in the request. That compactness is why you see that claims only use three or four letters, such as `sub` and `name`.

There are several [standard claim fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token#Standard_fields) defined in the JSON standard. You're not required to use any of them, but if you'll be integrating with third parties that may consume your API, or you have to pass the JWT token to another system, they're useful.

Now copy and paste the sample token from the beginning of the chapter into the "Encoded" side. Then, look at the "Payload" section of the decoded token:

![JWT io provided token](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176076143-52f27384-8d8c-4c83-955c-5d145c97a203.png)

You'll see the standard field `sub` (subject) has the value `23`, which is the unique user ID of the user that's logged in. There are two non-standard fields, `name` and `role`, that store the username and role of the logged-in user: `dave` and `admin`.

For authorization purposes, you'll want at least the user ID or name, and their role or permissions. Remember, the client sends the JWT on every request, and the server _only_ uses the token to determine whether the user is authorized for a resource or action.

There are two other fields to note: `iat` and `exp`. The values in these fields are dates in a format called Unix time. These two fields represent the time the token was "issued at" (`iat`) and the expiration (`exp`) time of the token. While neither is required, it's usually a good idea to include an expiration date to prevent token misuse. The value you choose for the expiration depends on the needs of your application.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What's Unix time?**
>
>[Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) is a date and time format that's represented as the number of seconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`. Unix time is a compact way of storing a date and time without having to worry about format, timezone, and the ordering of month/date/year. Most modern programming languages provide methods to convert to Unix time and back.

# Using JWTs

To authenticate with an API, there's typically an endpoint that you can send your username and password to through a `POST` request. You make this request using the `exchange()` method in the `RestTemplate` class:

```java
// username and password in JSON format escaping the double quote
String json = "{\"username\":\"user\",\"password\":\"password\"}";

HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
HttpEntity<Void> entity = new HttpEntity<>(json, headers);
ResponseEntity<Map> response = restTemplate.exchange(
    "http://localhost:8080/login", HttpMethod.POST, entity, Map.class);
```

The `HttpHeaders` class is a data structure representing HTTP request or response headers, mapping `String` header names to a list of `String` values. In this example, you set the `Content-Type` header to a value of `application/json`. To send the JSON payload and headers in the request, you need to attach them to an `HttpEntity`. The `RestTemplate`'s `exchange()` method provides more control over the convenience methods you've seen so far.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What's a convenience method?**
>
>A convenience method is a method that makes something complex or verbose more convenient and accessible to use.

Look at the `exchange()` method below:

```
exchange(URI url, HttpMethod method, HttpEntity<?> requestEntity, Class<T> responseType)
```

The `exchange()` method returns a `ResponseEntity<T>`. In this case, you know you're getting back key-value pairs in the form of a JSON string, so the type is `ResponseEntity<Map>`. This allows you to retrieve the value of the token using the key:

```json
String token = response.getBody().get("token")
```

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Example names**
>
>Remember these fields are for illustrative purposes. The information you receive from another developer's API may have different names or contain other data.

To use the token in requests, you pass the token in the bearer authentication header before you make the request:

```java
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.setBearerAuth(token);
HttpEntity<Void> entity = new HttpEntity<>(headers);
ResponseEntity<Location[]> response = restTemplate.exchange(
    "http://localhost:8080/locations", HttpMethod.GET, entity, Location[].class);
```

## HTTP response codes

There are two response codes that you need to be aware of when consuming an API that requires authentication. If you remember from a previous lesson, `4xx` codes are client-side errors:

| **Status Code** | **Description** | **Cause**                                                      |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `401`           | `Unauthorized`  | Occurs when you don't supply authentication credentials.       |
| `403`           | `Forbidden`     | Occurs when your credentials aren't authorized for a resource. |

You'll want to check for these status codes when you handle unsuccessful responses so you provide the appropriate feedback to the user, such as prompting them to log in or informing them that they aren't authorized for the resource.

# Securing API methods

By default, all of the endpoints in your API are open to anyone who wants to call them. Inevitably, you'll want to secure your API endpoints. Spring Security provides the `@PreAuthorize` annotation which determines whether the user can invoke the method or not. The `@PreAuthorize` annotation takes in a Spring Expression as an argument.

The Spring Expression Language ("SpEL" for short) is a powerful expression language that supports querying and manipulating classes at runtime. This isn't something you need to fully understand, but if you want to learn more, you can read the [SpEL documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions) .

The [Spring Security documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/expression-based.html) includes a list of common expressions that you can use to secure your API endpoints. You'll mainly use the following expressions:

-   `@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")`: The user must be authenticated.
-   `@PreAuthorize("permitAll")`: The user doesn't have to be authenticated.
-   `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`: The user must be authenticated and have the role ADMIN.
-   `@PreAuthorize("hasAnyRole('ADMIN', 'USER')")`: The user must be authenticated and have either the ADMIN or USER role.

Here's an example of class-based authentication where each method inherits from the class rule of `isAuthenticated()`:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/locations")
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
public class LocationController {

    @RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Location> list() {
        // inherits authentication from controller
    }

    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    @RequestMapping(value = "", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public Location add(@Valid @RequestBody Location location) {
        // inherits authentication from controller
    }

}
```

Here's an example of method authorization:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/locations")
public class LocationController {

    @PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
    @RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Location> list() {
        // you must be authenticated to invoke this method
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/public", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public void notsecure() {
        // this method doesn't require authentication
    }

}
```

## Allow anonymous access

If you need to make one action method open to anonymous accessâ€”meaning no authorizationâ€”while the rest of the controller requires authorization, you can use the `permitAll` expression in the `@PreAuthorize` annotation. A good use case for this is when you have an action method for users to log in along the same route for methods that do require authorization:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
public class UserController {

    @PreAuthorize("permitAll")
    @RequestMapping(path = "/login", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String login() {

    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<User> list() {

    }
}
```

## Require role

But what if you need to make sure only some logged-in users can access a resource and others can't? For this situation, you can pass the expression `hasRole('ROLE_NAME')` to the `@PreAuthorize` annotation. In the following example, an authenticated user can access any of the methods, but only an authenticated user with the role of `admin` can access the `add()` method:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/locations")
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
public class LocationController {

    private LocationDAO dao;

    public LocationController() {
        dao = new MemoryLocationDAO();
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Location> list() {
        return dao.list();
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public Location get(@PathVariable int id) throws LocationNotFoundException {
        return dao.get(id);
    }

    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    @RequestMapping(value = "", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public Location add(@Valid @RequestBody Location location) {
        return dao.create(location);
    }


}
```

If you need to allow for multiple roles, you can specify them in a comma-separated list using the expression `hasAnyRole`:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasAnyRole('ADMIN', 'USER')")
```

---

# User identity

There are situations where you not only want to know that the user is authenticated and that they have a certain role, but more specifically, the identity of the user. For example, while adding a new location, you also want to log which user created it. You can do so by declaring a new argument on your method of type `Principal`, and it'll be resolved by the Spring Framework. Once you have a `Principal` object, you can get the current user by calling `getName()`:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
@RequestMapping(value = "", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public Location add(@Valid @RequestBody Location location, Principal principal) {
    System.out.println(principal.getName());
    return dao.create(location);
}
```

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What's a principal?**
>
>In Spring Security, the current logged-in user is a **Principal**. A principal in computer security is an entity that can be authenticated by a computer system or network.

Right now, you may wonder how you can declare a type of `Principal` and get the current logged-in user. For now, understand that if you declare [one of these types](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-methods) in a method that's annotated with `@RequestMapping`, the Spring Framework tries to resolve it for you.

## **Securing APIs 3**

**You've authenticated with a server and received a JSON Web Token (JWT). What must you do in subsequent requests to the same server?**

â—‹ Include the JWT in the body of the request labeled `token`.

â—‹ Add the JWT as a query string to all request URLs with the key name `jwt`.

â—‰ Send the JWT in the Authorization HTTP header.

â—‹ Nothing. You've authenticated onceâ€”the server knows who you are.


## **Securing APIs 4**

**The "payload" section of a JWT contains data known as what?**

â—‹ Authorizations

â—‰ Claims

â—‹ Ownership factors

â—‹ Secrets

**Explanation:** Claims are statements about an entity, typically a user.


## **Securing APIs 5**

**You have a JWT stored in a string named AUTH_TOKEN. How do you pass a JWT with RestTemplate requests? Put the following statements in order:**

â–¤
```java
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.setBearerAuth(AUTH_TOKEN);
```

â–¤
```java
HttpEntity<Void> entity = new HttpEntity<>(headers);
```

â–¤
```java
ResponseEntity<Location[]> response =
   restTemplate.exchange(URL, HttpMethod.GET, entity, Location[].class);
```

â–¤
```java
Location[] locations = response.getBody();
```

**Explanation:** This is the correct way to create a bearer auth header, attach it to the entity, and pass it to the exchange method.


## **Securing APIs 6**

**If your client application received a 403 Forbidden, what does that mean about your request?**

â—‹ The request needs to pass authentication credentials with the request.

â—‹ There's no resource located at the URL.

â—‰ The request was to a resource that the authenticated user doesn't have permission for.

â—‹ Requests aren't allowed from your IP address.

**Explanation:** 403 is the response received when you provide authorization details, but the user doesn't have permission.


## **Securing APIs 7**

**What can you tell from the following class and method declarations?**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
public class UserController {

      @RequestMapping(path = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
      public User get() {
         ...
      }

      @RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.POST)
      public User create() {
         ...
      }

      @RequestMapping(path = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
      public User update() {
         ...
      }

      @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
      @RequestMapping(path = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
      public User delete() {
         ...
      }

}
```

	Select all correct options

â–¡ Only the `delete()` method requires the user to be authenticated.

â–  All methods in the controller require the user to be authenticated.

â–¡ The `get()`, `post()`, and `put()` methods don't require the user to be authenticated.

â–¡ Only JWT authentication is accepted.

â–  The `delete()` method can only be accessed by users with the role of `ADMIN`.

**Explanation:** 
-   All methods require an authenticated user because of the `@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")` annotation on the class.
-   Because this method has the `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` annotation, only admins can access the `delete()` method.


## **Securing APIs 8**

**How do you declare a method that doesn't need authorization in a controller that has the `@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")` annotation?**

â—‰ `@PreAuthorize("permitAll")`

â—‹ `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ANONYMOUS')")`

â—‹ `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('NONE')")`

â—‹ `@NoAuth`
