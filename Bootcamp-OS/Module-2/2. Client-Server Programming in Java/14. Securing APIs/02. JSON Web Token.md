# JSON Web Token

The **JSON Web Token** (JWT) is a compact method of securely transmitting information between parties. When decoded, this information is a JSON object. JWTs can be used for transmitting nearly any data, but they're used primarily for authorization in APIs and other HTTP requests. JWTs are ideal because of their small size, and being an open standard, anyone can implement code to read and write JWTs.

When a user authenticates with an application that uses JWTs, the server creates the token and returns it to the client in the response:

```json
{
  "id": 23,
  "username": "dave",
  "role": "admin",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIyMyIsIm5hbWUiOiJkYXZlIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNTkwNzgwNTcwLCJleHAiOjE1OTEzODUzNzB9.k-8tPLjLqzcaNz7yuFpCsOQlic2NofJ-BSu-EkdmW7Q"
}
```

>The information you receive from another developer's API may have different names or contain other data.

Now that the client has the token, it must include that token in every API request that requires authorization. The JWT token goes in the `Authorization` HTTP header with the word `Bearer`. This indicates the type of authentication:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIyMyIsIm5hbWUiOiJkYXZlIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNTkwNzgwNTcwLCJleHAiOjE1OTEzODUzNzB9.k-8tPLjLqzcaNz7yuFpCsOQlic2NofJ-BSu-EkdmW7Q
```

When the server receives the request, it verifies the accuracy of the JWT and allows access to the resource if the user is authorized for it.

## Decoding JWTs

So far you've only seen JWTs in their encoded form. It's difficult to debug or diagnose an issue with a JWT in this format. However, as long as the token isn't encrypted, it's possible to decode the JWT to view the contents.

There are a number of tools online to decode a JWT, but one of the most popular is [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) . When you open the site, they pre-populate a sample token. Start by looking at their sample token and the decoded data:

![JWT io sample token](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176076075-212f9f30-74e4-4349-b3de-7c67d6de7b26.png)

If you look in the "decoded" side, there are three components to a JWT: header, payload (data), and signature:

-   The **header** provides information about the token itself. Typically, it only contains the algorithm (`alg`) used to sign, and the type (`typ`) of token, which is usually "JWT", but the standard allows for other types of tokens in the future.
-   The **payload** is the actual data of the token, which are also called claims. **Claims** are statements about an entity, such as a user, and additional data, such as the time the token was issued or expires. You can add custom claims, as you'll see in the next example.
-   The **signature** is verification that the data hasn't been tampered with. The server creates the signature by encoding the header and payload, combining it with a "secret"â€”typically only known by the serverâ€”and creating a hash based on the algorithm defined in the header. Since the secret is only known by the server, the server is the only one that can verify tokens and create new ones.

With the color-coded representation of the JWT, you can see that even when it's in encoded form, you can still see the three distinct parts of the token. Tokens are always in a `header.payload.signature` format.

## Claims

As stated before, claims are statements about an entity, typically a user. While most of the JWT standard is strict, you have some flexibility on the data stored in the payload section, though you want to keep the token small so it transmits quickly in the request. That compactness is why you see that claims only use three or four letters, such as `sub` and `name`.

There are several [standard claim fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token#Standard_fields) defined in the JSON standard. You're not required to use any of them, but if you'll be integrating with third parties that may consume your API, or you have to pass the JWT token to another system, they're useful.

Now copy and paste the sample token from the beginning of the chapter into the "Encoded" side. Then, look at the "Payload" section of the decoded token:

![JWT io provided token](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176076143-52f27384-8d8c-4c83-955c-5d145c97a203.png)

You'll see the standard field `sub` (subject) has the value `23`, which is the unique user ID of the user that's logged in. There are two non-standard fields, `name` and `role`, that store the username and role of the logged-in user: `dave` and `admin`.

For authorization purposes, you'll want at least the user ID or name, and their role or permissions. Remember, the client sends the JWT on every request, and the server _only_ uses the token to determine whether the user is authorized for a resource or action.

There are two other fields to note: `iat` and `exp`. The values in these fields are dates in a format called Unix time. These two fields represent the time the token was "issued at" (`iat`) and the expiration (`exp`) time of the token. While neither is required, it's usually a good idea to include an expiration date to prevent token misuse. The value you choose for the expiration depends on the needs of your application.

>[Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) is a date and time format that's represented as the number of seconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`. Unix time is a compact way of storing a date and time without having to worry about format, timezone, and the ordering of month/date/year. Most modern programming languages provide methods to convert to Unix time and back.
