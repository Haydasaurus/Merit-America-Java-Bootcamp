# Introduction

You've learned how to retrieve data from web APIs, but what about more complicated interactions, such as sending data? If a request fails, how do you handle errors? In this unit, you'll learn how to make these requests and handle any issues that arise.

## POST, PUT, DELETE

There are ways to interact with web APIs that create, update, and delete data. Typically, create, update, and delete endpoints respond to `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` HTTP methods, respectively.

You may already be familiar with `POST` requests without knowing it. If you've ever submitted information on a webpage form, this data is usually transmitted through a `POST` request to the server.

---

# Requests with code

As with `GET` requests, you can use `RestTemplate` to perform `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests. Similar to how you used `.getForObject()` for `GET` requests, there are corresponding `.postForObject()`, `.put()`, and `.delete()` methods.

To make a `POST` or `PUT` request, you'll often need to submit data as well. With `RestTemplate`, you can submit that data as an object, and `RestTemplate` automatically serializes it into a format that the server can read.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What does serialize mean?**
>
>**Serialize** means converting an object into a string. It's the opposite of the term "deserialize", which you learned in the last unit.

## POST requests

The syntax for making a `POST` request with an object is similar to the syntax for making a `GET` request with type parameters. With `POST` requests, there's one additional step: attaching the data to the request.

In the following example, you create a new `User` object and add it to the request using an `HttpEntity`, which combines the `User` object with the HTTP header `Content-Type=application/json`:

```java
User newUser = new User();
User.setFirstName("Fred");
User.setLastName("Smith");
User.setEmail("fred@example.com");

// Create instance of RestTemplate
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

// Create instance of HttpHeaders and set Content-Type to application/json
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);

// Combine headers with new user object to form HttpEntity
HttpEntity<User> entity = new HttpEntity<>(newUser, headers);

// Post (add) the new user using the entity.
newUser = restTemplate.postForObject(API_URL + "users", entity, User.class);
```

It's important to note the third parameter in the method call, `restTemplate.postForObject(..., ..., User.class)`. The `postForObject()` method returns the newly posted object and uses the third parameter as a template to _deserialize_ the returned JSON. In this case, since a `User` object was posted, you'd expect the returned object to be of type `User`, so the method is passed the `User.class` as the template.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: About .class**
>
>A class name, like `User` followed by `.class`, is called a **class literal** in Java. It's a way to programmatically refer to the underlying structure of a class so that the serializer or deserializer can map JSON values to the corresponding object attributes.

## PUT requests

A `PUT` request is like a `POST` request, but you use the `.put()` method instead. You also still need to combine the `Content-Type=application/json` header with the object using an `HttpEntity`. However, you don't need to use the type parameter as you won't usually receive any data from a `PUT` request:

```java
User existingUser = new User();
existingUser.setFirstName("Fredrick");
existingUser.setLastName("Smith");
existingUser.setEmail("fred@example.com");

// Create instance of RestTemplate
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

// Create instance of HttpHeaders and set Content-Type to application/json
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);

// Combine headers with existing user object to form HttpEntity
HttpEntity<User> entity = new HttpEntity<>(existingUser, headers);

// Put (update) the existing user using the entity.
restTemplate.put(API_URL + "users/23", entity);
```

Notice that the URL in this example has `23` at the end of it. A `PUT` method updates existing data, and typically a unique identifier, such as a numerical ID, is in the URL to identify the object that you want to update.

### PUT requests replace data

When performing a `PUT` request, you're usually expected to send the _entire object_, including parts that you haven't modified. This is because the server often _replaces_ the entire object or record with the data supplied. This behavior is mainly due to the [HTTP standard](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#PUT) , which states that a `PUT` request creates or replaces the existing data with the data that's sent.

It's up to the API developer to decide to follow the standard or not. As stated before, following the standard is best practice and indicates to other developers how the data changes on the server.

This behavior also explains why `.put()` doesn't return the updated object like `.postForObject()`. Since `.put()` assumes that the server _replaces_ the object or record with the data supplied, there's no need to return the updated data since it's identical.

## DELETE requests

`DELETE` requests usually only require the ID, like `PUT` requests, but they don't require any additional data. You also don't need to use the type parameter as you won't usually receive any data from a `DELETE` request:

```java
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
restTemplate.delete(API_URL + "users/23");
```

# Requests with Postman

You can use Postman to make `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests in addition to making `GET` requests. You can change the request method by clicking on the drop-down to the left of the URL field:

![Postman methods drop-down](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176072613-c5d5aed5-14cc-48f3-af92-f81e63ed86dd.png)

Select the request method that you want from the list:

![Postman methods list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176072699-654fc668-4263-440e-af5e-8c8dab3cfeba.png)

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Postman request methods**
>
>When you open the drop-down list, you'll see that Postman offers other request methods. However, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` are most commonly used with web APIs.
>
>The Intro to Tools: Postman unit can help you learn the Postman interface, how to create different types of requests, and how to add data to a request.

## POST requests

To send data for `POST` and `PUT` requests, you use the "Body" tab. To send data in JSON format, select the **raw** radio button. After you select the radio button, a drop-down appears to the right of the last radio button that allows you to select different "raw" formats, such as JSON:

![JSON format](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176072793-3742aa68-a08e-4e43-91b3-ce144a1fb5d7.png)

Once you send the request, if the API is configured to respond with data, you'll see the data in the response "Body" tab below, similarly to `GET` requests:

![Postman POST Response](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176072901-e8bb0893-6dbe-42cf-8ffc-edebc9ade95f.png)

You may notice that Postman also offers multiple body formats. The format you use depends on what the API expects and the data you're sending. The most commonly used formats are:

-   `form-data` is the same way data is submitted on a website form using key-value pairs. You can also attach and upload files with this format.
-   `x-www-form-urlencoded` is another key-value pair format, where all non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with a "URL encoded" value. You may be familiar with this if you've ever seen `%20` instead of a space in a filename. Files can't be attached in this format. This isn't usually interchangeable with `form-data`.
-   `raw` lets you enter plain text. This format is helpful if you need to send JSON or XML.

## PUT requests

The same rules apply for `PUT` requests: you must send the entire data object or record, and you'll often use a numerical ID in the URL.

![Postman PUT Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176073016-0b1f36cf-c810-43fa-a48d-9e5fd7eeda63.png)

## DELETE requests

As with making the request in code, a `DELETE` request doesn't typically need body data, and you'll often use a numerical ID in the URL as well:

![Postman DELETE Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176073140-fc82ce72-ec13-4720-adc9-dcb45b958245.png)

# Handling errors

Eventually you'll encounter an error when interacting with an API. You might receive a 4xx or 5xx status code from the server, or your request may not reach the server due to network issues, such as losing connectivity or a failed DNS lookup.

## Network errors

`RestTemplate` alerts an application of any errors by throwing Java exceptions rather than returning error or status codes. This means using `try/catch` blocks.

In the case of general network I/O, errors that prevent the request from reaching the server, like the server being offline, or prevent the response from coming back, like losing your connection, are reflected as a failure to access a resource.

`RestTemplate` throws a `ResourceAccessException` to alert the application that there was a network I/O problem:

```java
try {
    restTemplate.put(API_URL + "users/remove/23");
}
catch (ResourceAccessException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
```

Since the error is related to the network, the application usually can't resolve the issue unless the error is an invalid URL or a similar configuration issue. Frequently, the only course of action is to report the error and possibly allow the user to retry.

## 4xx and 5xx response codes

Assuming there are no network problems, there are still potential errors that are reflected in the response status code. In an earlier unit, you learned that status codes 200-299 mean success, and 400-599 status codes are for errors.

`RestTemplate` throws a `RestClientResponseException` for any response status code in the 400-599 range:

```java
try {
    restTemplate.delete(API_URL + "users/remove/23");
}
catch (RestClientResponseException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getRawStatusCode());
}
```

`RestClientResponseException` has several useful messages that can clarify and potentially allow the application to understand and correct problems:

| **Method**                | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| getRawStatusCode()        | Returns the raw HTTP status code value                       |
| getStatusText()           | Returns the HTTP status text                                 |
| getResponseHeaders()      | Returns HTTP response headers (may be null)                  |
| getResponseBodyAsString() | Returns HTTP response body converted to String (may be null) |

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What about 1xx and 3xx response status codes?**
>
>Even though 1xx status codes are part of the HTTP specification, they are used primarily in traditional web apps. You won't often see one as a response from an API.  
  >
>Similarly, 3xx codes are typically used by servers that host websites. For example, if a URL changed for a page, the server responds with a `301 Moved Permanently` or `302 Found`. Web APIs, on the other hand, typically don't change endpoints as it may break existing applications.  
  >
>The main focus of API designers is on simplicity and ease of use. They want application programmers to make use of the services they've created. Forcing application developers to handle 1xx or 3xx response codes complicates their work, and sours their impression and usage of an API.

## Putting it together

Now you know how to handle different types of errors, how do you put these techniques together?

Here, you cascade the `catch` blocks:

```java
try {
    restTemplate.put(API_URL + "users/remove/23");
}
catch (ResourceAccessException e) {
    // Handle network I/O errors
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
catch (RestClientResponseException e) {
    // Handle response status codes 4xx and 5xx
    System.out.println(e.getRawStatusCode());
}
```

# Choosing the right method

Although there's nothing preventing you from having a data-changing method respond to whatever HTTP method you wantâ€”for example, a delete method responding to a `GET` requestâ€”it's generally considered best practice to have them tied to the right HTTP methods.

The HTTP method used indicates how the data does or doesn't change on the server. This is important because you may not be the same developer creating the frontend, or you may want your API to be public and used by other developers.

You may have heard the term "REST" or "RESTful" when it comes to APIs. The formal description is rather verbose and technical, but what it means is using HTTP to interact with other applicationsâ€”that means using URLs and standard HTTP methods. There is no REST "standard" as it's more of an architectural style, but it does rely on the HTTP standards. The HTTP standards essentially define the HTTP methods as:

-   `GET` for returning resources
-   `POST` for creating a new resource
-   `PUT` for updating a resource
-   `DELETE` for deleting a resource

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Method definitions**
>
>The method definitions are a little more verbose, but this is what they essentially mean. If you want to read the formal definitions, they're available from the [IETF HTTP Working Group](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#method.definitions) .
>
>Another reason to not use `GET` on methods that modify data is that `GET` requests can be cached by the browser, server, or any intermediary. If the request was cached, you may not have the data change that you're expecting or the request may not even reach the server. `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests can't be cached.

# Quiz

## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 2) 1**

**What `RestTemplate` method should you use to send a request to a web service that creates a new resource?**

â—‹ `.getForObject()`

â—‰ `.postForObject()`

â—‹ `.post()`

â—‹ `.put()`

**Explanation:** `.postForObject()` sends the serialized object as the body of the request.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 2) 2**

**The following code is supposed to update `myPet` using a web service. What's the problem with it?**

```java
myPet.setFavoriteFood("Tuna");
RestTemplate template = new RestTemplate();
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
HttpEntity<Pet> entity = new HttpEntity<>(myPet.getFavoriteFood(), headers);
restTemplate.put(API_URL + "/pets/" + myPet.getId(), entity);
```

â—‰ including `myPet.getFavoriteFood()` rather than `myPet` in the `HttpEntity`

â—‹ appending the ID of `myPet` to the "/pets/" API endpoint

â—‹ using `.put()` instead of `postForObject()`

â—‹ not assigning the value returned by `.put()` to `myPet`

**Explanation:** The entire object should be included because a `PUT` request typically replaces the entire object/record on the backend with the data sent.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 2) 3**

**Which of the following problems can cause a `ResourceAccessException`?**

	Select all correct options

â–¡ receiving a `403 Forbidden` response status code

â–  a poor wi-fi connection

â–¡ incorrect request headers

â–  the API server being down for maintenance

â–  incorrect spelling of the domain name in the address of the API endpoint

**Explanation:** Any problem that interferes with network communication and prevents receiving a response can cause a `ResourceAccessException`.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 2) 4**

**True or False: Serialization is converting a string into an object.**

â—‹ True

â—‰ False

**Explanation:** Serialization is converting an object into a string.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 2) 5**

**Which of these response status codes would cause a `RestClientResponseException`?**

	Select all correct options

â–¡ `200 OK`

â–¡ `204 No Content`

â–  `404 Not Found`

â–  `451 Unavailable for Legal Reasons`

â–  `503 Service Unavailable`

**Explanation:** Any response status code in the 4xx or 5xx range causes a `RestClientResponseException`.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 2) 6**

**Which HTTP methods typically include a body with the request?**

	Select all correct options

â–¡ `GET`

â–  `POST`

â–  `PUT`

â–¡ `DELETE`

**Explanation:** `POST` and `PUT` add and update data. The data to be added or updated is sent in the body of the request.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 2) 7**

**After sending a request with `RestTemplate` and receiving a response status code that indicates an error, which method returns the numeric value of that response status code?**

â—‰ the `getRawStatusCode()` method of `RestClientResponseException`

â—‹ the `getMessage()` method of `RestClientResponseException`

â—‹ the `getRawStatusCode()` method of `ResourceAccessException`

â—‹ the `getMessage()` method of `ResourceAccessException`

**Explanation:** A `RestClientResponseException` is thrown when the response status code indicates an error. The `getRawStatusCode()` method returns the numeric value of that status code as an `int`.


## **Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 2) 8**

**True or False: When calling the `delete()` method of `RestTemplate`, the only necessary parameter is the URL of the API endpoint.**

â—‰ True

â—‹ False

**Explanation:** Typically, the URL includes the ID of the resource being deleted.
