# Quiz

## **Database Design 1**

**True or False: A primary key must be a single database column containing a unique value for each row of a table.**

○ True

◉ False

**Explanation:** While primary keys are often only a single column, a primary key may also be made up of several columns, in which case it is referred to as a composite primary key.


## **Database Design 2**

**Which one of the following would typically be a one-to-many relationship?**

○ recipes and ingredients

○ movies and actors

◉ countries and cities

○ games and players

**Explanation:** Since a country contains many cities, but a city is only in one country, this is a one-to-many relationship.


## **Database Design 3**

**Which one of the following would typically be a many-to-many relationship?**

○ customers and orders

◉ smartphones and apps

○ contacts and email addresses

○ supervisors and employees

**Explanation:** Since a smartphone can have many apps installed on it, and apps can be installed on many smartphones, this is a many-to-many relationship.


## **Database Design 4**

**Consider the following `product` table. Which of its fields do not depend on the primary key?**

![product table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176062817-66a0db5b-5f9c-46d4-b3dd-a60d48a2a315.png)

	Select all correct options

□ `product_name`

□ `product_description`

□ `manufacturer_id`

■ `manufacturer_name`

■ `manufacturer_address`

**Explanation:** `manufacturer_name` and `manufacturer_address` depend on the `manufacturer_id` rather than `product_id`. For greater normalization, the database designer would move those fields to a separate `manufacturer` table.


## **Database Design 5**

**A database being designed to track airline data has a `flight` table and a `passenger` table. Which of these options would be the best way to relate those tables to support a report of all the passengers for a particular flight as well as a report of all the flights for a particular passenger?**

◉ Create a new `flight_passenger` table with `flight_id` and `passenger_id` as foreign keys

○ Add `flight_id` to the `passenger` table as a foreign key

○ Add `passenger_id` to the `flight` table as a foreign key

○ Add `flight_id` to `passenger` as a foreign key and `passenger_id` to `flight` as a foreign key

**Explanation:** To create the many-to-many relationship between `flight` and `passenger` a third table is needed. That table is referred to as an "associative entity" or "linking table."


## **Database Design 6**

**True or False: The `NUMERIC` data type is a common choice for a primary key field**

○ True

◉ False

**Explanation:** The `NUMERIC` data type is for decimal values, and is unlikely to be used for primary key fields. Tables often have integer ids as their primary keys.


## **Database Design 7**

**In what order would you normally perform the following tasks when creating a database?**

▤ Identify the entities to be represented by tables

▤ Determine how the tables are related

▤ Finalize table designs with specific data types and sizes

▤ Write and run DDL statements to create tables

▤ Run SQL `INSERT` statements to populate tables with data

**Explanation:** Database design is an iterative process, so some or all of these steps may need to be repeated later, but this would be a good approach to creating the first version of a database.


## **Database Design 8**

**After the following SQL runs, which field of the `purchase` table is a foreign key?**

```sql
CREATE TABLE purchase(
    purchase_id serial NOT NULL,
    delivered_on date NULL,
    customer_id int NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT PK_purchase PRIMARY KEY (purchase_id),
    CONSTRAINT FK_purchase_customer FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customer (id)
);
```

○ `purchase_id`

◉ `customer_id`

○ `id`

○ `FK_purchase_customer`

**Explanation:** `customer_id` is a foreign key. It would only be allowed to contain values found in the `id` field of the `customer` table.


## **Database Design 9**

**When writing several `DROP TABLE` statements to remove tables from a database, does it matter what order the `DROP TABLE` statements appear in?**

○ Yes, the database requires tables to be dropped in the same order they were created in.

○ Yes, the database requires tables to be dropped in the opposite order of the order they were created in.

◉ Yes, the database requires dependent tables to be dropped before the tables they depend on.

○ No, the database permits tables to be dropped in any order.

**Explanation:** Since dependent tables are normally created after the tables they depend on, dropping them in the opposite order is a good rule of thumb, but in a database with no foreign key constraints, tables could be dropped in any order.
