# Introduction

Over the past several units, you've learned what databases are and how to work with them. You can add, update, read, and delete data. You know what tables, rows, and columns represent. In addition, you understand that tables can be related to one another using primary and foreign keys.

Furthermore, you've learned that databases do more than store and retrieve data; they also protect the integrity of that data, principally through enforcing referential integrity. It's time to take your first steps into designing and creating databases.

Here are the primary activities of a developer who designs and implements a database:

1.  **Data modeling**: the process of clearly and precisely defining the data items to store. Both their purpose and use must be defined. This develops a relational data model.
    
2.  **Logical design**: the process of creating a design that follows the rules of the relational data model.
    
3.  **Physical design**: the process of adjusting the logical design to meet requirements related to performance, ease of use, and hardware and software relational database management system (RDBMS) limitations. This includes defining the data types for the columns and how much room to use to store the data.
    
4.  **Physical implementation**: the process of creating tables and supporting objects such as sequences, indexes, views and aliases, and granting user access on the tables or columns.
    

There are additional activities that have to do with the long-term administration of a running database. These lie outside the scope of this unit, but they include:

-   Monitoring access
-   Performing periodic backups
-   Performance enhancements such as reorgs and validity checking
-   Adjusting and creating indexes
-   Granting and revoking privileges in the database

These activities are generally assigned to a Database Administrator.

# Data modeling

To create a proper and effective relational database design, you start with a model of the data items to be stored and the business rules applicable to them.

A list of the data items and a brief summary of what they mean and how they’re used is enough to start. You don't need to be exhaustive. **_Designing and implementing a database is an iterative process._** You may find yourself switching between the various activities listed earlier.

For example, if you were designing a database for an online store, you might list data items like this:

| **Data Item**    | **Use and Business Rules**                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Customer Name    | Full name of customer                     |
| Customer Address | Street address of customer                |
| Customer City    | City name where the customer is located   |
| Customer State   | Standard USPS state code                  |
| Customer Phone   | (###) ###-#### format                     |
| Product Name     | Name of product displayed in online store |
| Product UPC      | 12 digits                                 |
| Product Price    | Price in USD                              |

## Identifying main entities

Once you have a reasonable data model, you’d need to identify the “things” that the data represents. What “things” does the data in the table describe?

Each “thing” is an entity, and each entity is represented as a table. Don’t think of all the entities or tables you might need—just start with a few. You’ll see that the process helps to identify other entities/tables as you move through it. **_Once again, the process is iterative._**

A good question to ask is: **_What do you want to keep track of?_**

Looking at the list of example data items in the previous section, they fall into the categories of Customers and Products, so you'd identify those as main entities.

## Identifying primary keys

In the relational model, a table can’t contain multiple rows that represent the same object. To ensure uniqueness, each table must have a column, or set of columns, called a **primary key**. A primary key uniquely identifies entries in the table. A primary key may be called a **simple key** if it’s a single column, or a **composite key** if it consists of several columns.

The required characteristics of a primary key are:

-   The values of primary key must be unique across rows.
-   The primary key must always have a value. In other words, it can't be NULL.

Some desirable characteristics of a primary key are:

-   A good primary key is simple and familiar—for example, an employee id for a table of employees, or an account number for a table of customers.
-   The value of the primary key shouldn’t change. Other tables may reference the primary key. If the value of a primary key changes, all references must also be changed.
-   Primary key values are often integers, but they could also be other types, like `CHAR` or `VARCHAR`.
-   Primary keys may be generated values. Most RDBMSs support some form of auto-incrementing values that may be used as a primary key.

## Identifying relationships between entities

A fundamental characteristic of an RDBMS is that the tables can be related to each other. The relationships that may exist between tables include:

-   **One-to-one**: where each entry in one table links to exactly one matching entry in another table. It's not unusual in a one-to-one relationship for the tables involved to have the same primary key.
-   **One-to-many**: where each entry in one table (parent) may link to many matching entries in another table (dependent).
-   **Many-to-many**: where each entry in one table may link to many matching entries in another table, each of which may be associated with multiple entries in the first table.

>**🛈 Note: Parent and dependent tables**
>
>**Parent table:** A table whose primary key is matched by foreign keys in one or more other tables.
>
>**Dependent table:** A table whose rows are dependent on an existing row in another table. The foreign key of a dependent matches the entire primary key of its parent.

Here’s how you’d handle each relationship at this point in the design:

| **Relationship** | **What to do**                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One-to-one       | Combine tables into one table                                                                                                                                                     |
| One-to-many      | Do nothing—this is the goal                                                                                                                                                       |
| Many-to-many     | Break the relationship into a pair of one-to-many relationships by creating a new associative entity with a composite primary key containing the primary keys of the two entities |

If you were designing a recipe database, you might have a table of recipes and a table of ingredients. Since a recipe uses many ingredients and an ingredient can be used in many recipes, this is an example of a many-to-many relationship. To represent that relationship, you'd add a new associative entity to your design—a linking table where each record contains both a recipe id and an ingredient id.

>**✔ Tip: Naming associative entities**
>
>Meaningful names for the associative entities may become apparent after the Normalization process, which is discussed in the next lesson.

## Cardinality and ordinality

**Cardinality** refers to the maximum number of times an instance in one entity can relate to instances of another entity.

**Ordinality** is the minimum number of times an instance in one entity can be associated with an instance in the related entity.

Cardinality and Ordinality are shown by the styling of a line and its endpoint:

![Cardinality Notation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176062708-f0d01c9f-1b68-47ce-aa7a-ea50b8681d95.png)

# Logical design

**Logical design** is the process of creating a design that adheres to the rules of the relational data model.

## Normalization

**Normalization** is a logical database design technique which organizes tables in a manner that reduces redundancy and dependency of data. It generally produces a number of smaller tables and links them using relationships.

E.F. Codd, author of the seminal _A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks_, created the theory of data placed in **normal forms** (NF). He originally devised three normal forms which have since grown to six or seven. A common goal of normalization in relational database design is to achieve **Third Normal Form** (3NF).

Each data item in a table is considered an atomic, standalone fact:

-   **First Normal Form** (1NF): For each entity, create a separate entity for repeating data groups. No fact may repeat in a table.
-   **Second Normal Form** (2NF): For each entity, create a separate entity for data elements that are based on a portion of the primary key. Each data item must be based on the entire primary key of the table.
-   **Third Normal Form** (3NF): For each entity, create a separate entity for data elements that are based on some other data element. Each data item must be based on only the primary key.

The normal forms are cumulative. You must be 1NF to be in 2NF, and you must be in 2NF to be in 3NF.

To determine if you're in 3NF, place a data item in a table and ask yourself two questions:

1.  **Is the fact or data element already in the table?** If the answer is no, you're in 1NF.
2.  **Is it a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key?** If the answer is yes, you're in 3NF. (The whole key checks 2NF; nothing but the key checks 3NF.)

If either of the questions results in the "wrong" answer, you must:

1.  Look for an existing table where the data item does fit, or
2.  Create a new table to hold the data item.

For example, if you were designing a database for a school, you might initially create a table in which each row represents a course and its students. Each record would have fields like:

-   course_id
-   course_name
-   student1_name
-   student1_status
-   student2_name
-   student2_status
-   student3_name
-   student3_status
-   and so on...

But repeating the data elements about students in each record means that this isn't 1NF. So, you'd move the data about students to a new table where each record represents one student.

As you continue designing the database for the school, you might set up a table to track grades on assignments, with each record having a composite primary key made up of an assignment id and a student id. As you add more data elements, you would make sure that they depend on the whole composite key. For example, adding a field for the grade received would be fine since each grade is for a specific combination of a student and assignment.

Adding a field for the name of the assignment would violate 2NF, however, because it only depends on the assignment id. It doesn't vary for each student. So, you'd find another table to hold that element—such as a table where each record represents an assignment.

When adding data elements about teachers to your design, the table with course data might be a good location. Each course has a teacher, so adding a teacher id to each record in that table makes sense.

However, if you then wanted to add the teacher's phone number, that would violate 3NF because the teacher's phone number depends on the teacher id rather than on the primary key of the table (the course id). So, you'd add the phone number to a table where the teacher id is the primary key.

>**🛈 Note: Creating new tables**
>
>When you create the new table, you must also follow the subsequent steps in the process—designating primary keys and establishing relationships—before continuing to another data item.

## Verifying integrity

You must apply integrity rules to verify the validity of your design. There are various types of integrity rules.

**Entity Integrity Rule**: The primary key can't contain NULL. It must uniquely identify the row. For a composite key made up of several columns, none of the columns can contain NULL. Most of the RDBMSs check and enforce this rule.

**Referential Integrity Rule**: Each foreign key value must be matched to an entire primary key value in the table referenced (parent table).

You can insert a row with a foreign key in the dependent table only if the value exists in the parent table. If the value of the primary key changes in the parent table—meaning that the primary key value is updated or row is deleted—all rows with the matching foreign key in the dependent tables must be considered or handled accordingly. Your options include:

1.  Disallow the change to the primary key. This is most common.
    
2.  Cascade the change to the primary key by changing all the matching foreign keys in all dependents.
    
3.  Delete the matching dependent rows.
    
4.  Set the foreign key value in the matching dependent rows to NULL. This can be done only if the foreign key isn't part of the primary key of the dependent table. See Entity Integrity Rule.
    

Most RDBMSs can be set up to perform the check and ensure the referential integrity in the specified manner.

**Business Logic Integrity**: There could be integrity validation pertaining to the business logic. Some examples include:

-   Zip code must be five digits within a certain range
    
-   Delivery date and time must fall within business hours
    
-   Quantity ordered must be equal or less than quantity in stock
    

These could be handled in RDBMS-managed validation rules for the specific column or programming logic.

# Physical design

**Physical design** is the stage of the database design process where you'll make decisions about the type and size of each data element.

## Data types

In an earlier unit, you learned about the commonly used ANSI SQL data types, and that every RDBMS also offers its own proprietary data types. For each field in the tables you've designed, you'll select the data type that's most appropriate. The ANSI SQL data types you're most likely to use are:

| **Type**                   | **Used for**                          | **Examples**                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **INTEGER**                | fields to contain whole numbers       | a counter or quantity               |
| **NUMERIC** or **DECIMAL** | fields to contain decimal values      | a weight or temperature             |
| **VARCHAR**                | fields to contain text                | a name or description               |
| **DATE**                   | fields to contain a date, but no time | a birthday or expiration date       |
| **TIMESTAMP**              | fields to contain a date and time     | a calendar appointment or log event |

### Auto-incrementing ids

Tables often have integer ids as their primary keys, and it's convenient to have these values automatically increment each time a new record is added. PostgreSQL provides the proprietary data type `serial` for this purpose.

## Data size

Some data types require parameters to be specified related to their size—for example, the maximum number of characters for a VARCHAR or the precision and scale for a NUMERIC. In most cases, you'll make these choices based on business rules and common sense, but performance may also be a consideration, depending on the RDMBS and the computing resources available to it.

---

# Physical implementation

**Physical implementation** is the stage of the design process where you'll translate your design from a drawing on paper or a whiteboard to actual code. You'll write a SQL script to implement your design using a subset of the language called **Data Definition Language** or **DDL**.

The most important DDL statements to be familiar with are `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, and `ALTER TABLE`.

## CREATE TABLE

The `CREATE TABLE` statement adds new tables to a database.

The first thing to include in a `CREATE TABLE` statement is the name of the new table. For example, if you were setting up a table to hold data about cities, you would start with:

```sql
CREATE TABLE city ();
```

Next, in the parentheses following the table name, you'll add a list of fields, specifying the name and data type for each. For the data types that require parameters, put those in parentheses following the type. For the table of cities, that might look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE city (
    city_id serial, --This is a PostgreSQL specific data type for auto-incrementing ints
    city_name varchar(50),
    population int,
    area numeric(5,1)
);
```

Finally, add constraints. A constraint that applies to a single field—like `NOT NULL`—is often specified immediately after the data type:

```sql
CREATE TABLE city (
    city_id serial,
    city_name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    population int NOT NULL,
    area numeric(5,1) NOT NULL
);
```

Constraints can also be added separately to the list of fields. For example, you can add the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint—which includes the `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints—like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE city (
    city_id serial,
    city_name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    population int NOT NULL,
    area numeric(5,1) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT PK_city PRIMARY KEY(city_id)
);
```

>**🛈 Note: Constraint names**
>
>Constraints can be named, which makes them easier to refer to. A common naming convention is to use a prefix that indicates the type of constraint followed by the names of the tables or fields affected by the constraint. For example:
>
>-   `PK_customer` would be a `PRIMARY KEY` constraint on the `customer` table.
>-   `FK_invoice_customer` would be a `FOREIGN KEY` constraint on the `invoice` table that relates it to the `customer` table.
>-   `UQ_name` would be a `UNIQUE` constraint on the `name` field.

## DROP TABLE

The `DROP TABLE` statement deletes a table, and all the data it contains, from the database.

When writing a SQL script that includes `CREATE TABLE` statements, it's convenient to include `DROP TABLE` statements at the beginning so the script can be re-run to reset the database. Without the `DROP TABLE` statements first, the `CREATE TABLE` statements would cause errors since you can't create a table that already exists.

Start by specifying the name of the table to you want to delete. For example, to remove a table named `product`, you'd do this:

```sql
DROP TABLE product;
```

`DROP TABLE` causes an error if the specified table doesn't exist. To avoid that error, add `IF EXISTS` like this:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product;
```

When executing `DROP TABLE` statements, the database must maintain referential integrity. This means an error occurs if you attempt to drop a table that's referenced by foreign keys. To eliminate the table along with all the foreign key constraints that reference it, add the `CASCADE` keyword after the table name:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product CASCADE;
```

## ALTER TABLE

The `ALTER TABLE` statement makes changes to an existing table. It can add or remove individual fields and constraints.

When writing a SQL script to implement a database design, it's sometimes necessary to add certain constraints after another table has been created or data has been inserted into tables. In those situations, rather than adding the constraints as part of the `CREATE TABLE` statement, you'll add them with an `ALTER TABLE`.

Most constraints are added using the same syntax they have in a `CREATE TABLE` statement. For example, if you had an `assignment` table that included a student id from the `student` table, you'd add the foreign key constraint like this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE assignment ADD CONSTRAINT FK_assignment_student FOREIGN KEY(student_id) REFERENCES student(student_id);
```

PostgreSQL handles `NOT NULL` constraints differently than other constraints. You add a `NOT NULL` constraint with `ALTER TABLE` like this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE assignment ALTER COLUMN student_id SET NOT NULL;
```

>**✔ Tip: Refer to an existing file**
>
>Since DDL isn't something most developers use on a regular basis, it's helpful to refer to an existing DDL file to remember the exact syntax when you are writing the SQL script for your database design. For example, you could refer to the files used to create the databases you've been using in prior units.

# Unit summary

Relational data is widely used in today's world. A proper and correct design is critical to the effectiveness of a relational database system.

The design process is sometimes ignored. Developers may just create tables and hope for the best. It's not uncommon to see a disorganized set of unrelated tables in a database. A poorly designed database may function, but performance and ease of use suffer.

The benefits of implementing a good design far outweigh the time that's thought to be saved by not doing it. Developers spend more time attempting to rectify any issues that result from implementing a database with a bad or nonexistent design.

In this unit, you've learned about:

-   Creating a data model
-   Identifying entities in a data model
-   Best practices for identifying primary keys
-   The different types of relationships between entities: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many
-   Normal forms
-   How to verify the validity of your design
-   Writing a SQL script with DDL to implement your design

# Quiz

## **Database Design 1**

**True or False: A primary key must be a single database column containing a unique value for each row of a table.**

○ True

◉ False

**Explanation:** While primary keys are often only a single column, a primary key may also be made up of several columns, in which case it is referred to as a composite primary key.


## **Database Design 2**

**Which one of the following would typically be a one-to-many relationship?**

○ recipes and ingredients

○ movies and actors

◉ countries and cities

○ games and players

**Explanation:** Since a country contains many cities, but a city is only in one country, this is a one-to-many relationship.


## **Database Design 3**

**Which one of the following would typically be a many-to-many relationship?**

○ customers and orders

◉ smartphones and apps

○ contacts and email addresses

○ supervisors and employees

**Explanation:** Since a smartphone can have many apps installed on it, and apps can be installed on many smartphones, this is a many-to-many relationship.


## **Database Design 4**

**Consider the following `product` table. Which of its fields do not depend on the primary key?**

![product table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176062817-66a0db5b-5f9c-46d4-b3dd-a60d48a2a315.png)

	Select all correct options

□ `product_name`

□ `product_description`

□ `manufacturer_id`

■ `manufacturer_name`

■ `manufacturer_address`

**Explanation:** `manufacturer_name` and `manufacturer_address` depend on the `manufacturer_id` rather than `product_id`. For greater normalization, the database designer would move those fields to a separate `manufacturer` table.


## **Database Design 5**

**A database being designed to track airline data has a `flight` table and a `passenger` table. Which of these options would be the best way to relate those tables to support a report of all the passengers for a particular flight as well as a report of all the flights for a particular passenger?**

◉ Create a new `flight_passenger` table with `flight_id` and `passenger_id` as foreign keys

○ Add `flight_id` to the `passenger` table as a foreign key

○ Add `passenger_id` to the `flight` table as a foreign key

○ Add `flight_id` to `passenger` as a foreign key and `passenger_id` to `flight` as a foreign key

**Explanation:** To create the many-to-many relationship between `flight` and `passenger` a third table is needed. That table is referred to as an "associative entity" or "linking table."


## **Database Design 6**

**True or False: The `NUMERIC` data type is a common choice for a primary key field**

○ True

◉ False

**Explanation:** The `NUMERIC` data type is for decimal values, and is unlikely to be used for primary key fields. Tables often have integer ids as their primary keys.


## **Database Design 7**

**In what order would you normally perform the following tasks when creating a database?**

▤ Identify the entities to be represented by tables

▤ Determine how the tables are related

▤ Finalize table designs with specific data types and sizes

▤ Write and run DDL statements to create tables

▤ Run SQL `INSERT` statements to populate tables with data

**Explanation:** Database design is an iterative process, so some or all of these steps may need to be repeated later, but this would be a good approach to creating the first version of a database.


## **Database Design 8**

**After the following SQL runs, which field of the `purchase` table is a foreign key?**

```sql
CREATE TABLE purchase(
    purchase_id serial NOT NULL,
    delivered_on date NULL,
    customer_id int NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT PK_purchase PRIMARY KEY (purchase_id),
    CONSTRAINT FK_purchase_customer FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customer (id)
);
```

○ `purchase_id`

◉ `customer_id`

○ `id`

○ `FK_purchase_customer`

**Explanation:** `customer_id` is a foreign key. It would only be allowed to contain values found in the `id` field of the `customer` table.


## **Database Design 9**

**When writing several `DROP TABLE` statements to remove tables from a database, does it matter what order the `DROP TABLE` statements appear in?**

○ Yes, the database requires tables to be dropped in the same order they were created in.

○ Yes, the database requires tables to be dropped in the opposite order of the order they were created in.

◉ Yes, the database requires dependent tables to be dropped before the tables they depend on.

○ No, the database permits tables to be dropped in any order.

**Explanation:** Since dependent tables are normally created after the tables they depend on, dropping them in the opposite order is a good rule of thumb, but in a database with no foreign key constraints, tables could be dropped in any order.
