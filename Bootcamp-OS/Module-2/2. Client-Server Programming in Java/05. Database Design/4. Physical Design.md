# Physical design

**Physical design** is the stage of the database design process where you'll make decisions about the type and size of each data element.

## Data types

In an earlier unit, you learned about the commonly used ANSI SQL data types, and that every RDBMS also offers its own proprietary data types. For each field in the tables you've designed, you'll select the data type that's most appropriate. The ANSI SQL data types you're most likely to use are:

| **Type**                   | **Used for**                          | **Examples**                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **INTEGER**                | fields to contain whole numbers       | a counter or quantity               |
| **NUMERIC** or **DECIMAL** | fields to contain decimal values      | a weight or temperature             |
| **VARCHAR**                | fields to contain text                | a name or description               |
| **DATE**                   | fields to contain a date, but no time | a birthday or expiration date       |
| **TIMESTAMP**              | fields to contain a date and time     | a calendar appointment or log event |

### Auto-incrementing ids

Tables often have integer ids as their primary keys, and it's convenient to have these values automatically increment each time a new record is added. PostgreSQL provides the proprietary data type `serial` for this purpose.

## Data size

Some data types require parameters to be specified related to their sizeâ€”for example, the maximum number of characters for a VARCHAR or the precision and scale for a NUMERIC. In most cases, you'll make these choices based on business rules and common sense, but performance may also be a consideration, depending on the RDMBS and the computing resources available to it.
