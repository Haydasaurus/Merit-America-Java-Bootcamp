# Unit summary

Relational data is widely used in today's world. A proper and correct design is critical to the effectiveness of a relational database system.

The design process is sometimes ignored. Developers may just create tables and hope for the best. It's not uncommon to see a disorganized set of unrelated tables in a database. A poorly designed database may function, but performance and ease of use suffer.

The benefits of implementing a good design far outweigh the time that's thought to be saved by not doing it. Developers spend more time attempting to rectify any issues that result from implementing a database with a bad or nonexistent design.
