# Data modeling

To create a proper and effective relational database design, you start with a model of the data items to be stored and the business rules applicable to them.

A list of the data items and a brief summary of what they mean and how they’re used is enough to start. You don't need to be exhaustive. _Designing and implementing a database is an iterative process._ You may find yourself switching between the various activities listed earlier.

For example, if you were designing a database for an online store, you might list data items like this:

| **Data Item**    | **Use and Business Rules**                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Customer Name    | Full name of customer                     |
| Customer Address | Street address of customer                |
| Customer City    | City name where the customer is located   |
| Customer State   | Standard USPS state code                  |
| Customer Phone   | (###) ###-#### format                     |
| Product Name     | Name of product displayed in online store |
| Product UPC      | 12 digits                                 |
| Product Price    | Price in USD                              |

## Identifying main entities

Once you have a reasonable data model, you’d need to identify the “things” that the data represents. What “things” does the data in the table describe?

Each “thing” is an entity, and each entity is represented as a table. Don’t think of all the entities or tables you might need—just start with a few. You’ll see that the process helps to identify other entities/tables as you move through it. _Once again, the process is iterative._

A good question to ask is: _What do you want to keep track of?_

Looking at the list of example data items in the previous section, they fall into the categories of Customers and Products, so you'd identify those as main entities.

## Identifying primary keys

In the relational model, a table can’t contain multiple rows that represent the same object. To ensure uniqueness, each table must have a column, or set of columns, called a **primary key**. A primary key uniquely identifies entries in the table. A primary key may be called a **simple key** if it’s a single column, or a **composite key** if it consists of several columns.

The required characteristics of a primary key are:

-   The values of primary key must be unique across rows.
-   The primary key must always have a value. In other words, it can't be NULL.

Some desirable characteristics of a primary key are:

-   A good primary key is simple and familiar—for example, an employee id for a table of employees, or an account number for a table of customers.
-   The value of the primary key shouldn’t change. Other tables may reference the primary key. If the value of a primary key changes, all references must also be changed.
-   Primary key values are often integers, but they could also be other types, like `CHAR` or `VARCHAR`.
-   Primary keys may be generated values. Most RDBMSs support some form of auto-incrementing values that may be used as a primary key.

## Identifying relationships between entities

A fundamental characteristic of an RDBMS is that the tables can be related to each other. The relationships that may exist between tables include:

-   **One-to-one**: where each entry in one table links to exactly one matching entry in another table. It's not unusual in a one-to-one relationship for the tables involved to have the same primary key.
-   **One-to-many**: where each entry in one table (parent) may link to many matching entries in another table (dependent).
-   **Many-to-many**: where each entry in one table may link to many matching entries in another table, each of which may be associated with multiple entries in the first table.

## Note: Parent and dependent tables

**Parent table:** A table whose primary key is matched by foreign keys in one or more other tables.

**Dependent table:** A table whose rows are dependent on an existing row in another table. The foreign key of a dependent matches the entire primary key of its parent.

Here’s how you’d handle each relationship at this point in the design:

| **Relationship** | **What to do**                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One-to-one       | Combine tables into one table                                                                                                                                                     |
| One-to-many      | Do nothing—this is the goal                                                                                                                                                       |
| Many-to-many     | Break the relationship into a pair of one-to-many relationships by creating a new associative entity with a composite primary key containing the primary keys of the two entities |

If you were designing a recipe database, you might have a table of recipes and a table of ingredients. Since a recipe uses many ingredients and an ingredient can be used in many recipes, this is an example of a many-to-many relationship. To represent that relationship, you'd add a new associative entity to your design—a linking table where each record contains both a recipe id and an ingredient id.

## Tip: Naming associative entities

Meaningful names for the associative entities may become apparent after the Normalization process, which is discussed in the next lesson.

## Cardinality and ordinality

**Cardinality** refers to the maximum number of times an instance in one entity can relate to instances of another entity.

**Ordinality** is the minimum number of times an instance in one entity can be associated with an instance in the related entity.

Cardinality and Ordinality are shown by the styling of a line and its endpoint:
