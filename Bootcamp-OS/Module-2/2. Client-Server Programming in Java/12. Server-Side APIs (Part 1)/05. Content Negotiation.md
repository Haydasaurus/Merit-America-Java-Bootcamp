# Content negotiation

When the `getTodos()` method returns a `List<String>` or a `List<Todo>`, how does Spring MVC know to send JSON data in the HTTP response?

**Content negotiation** is an HTTP mechanism that's used for serving different formats of a resource at the same URL. The client specifies which formats it can understand in the `Accept` header of the HTTP request. JSON is the default format for Spring MVC.

For example, here's the return type of `List<String>`:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public List<String> getTodos()
```

It returns data as a JSON array of strings:

```json
[
    "Wake up",
    "Shower",
    "Drive to work"
]
```

Here's the return type of `List<Todo>`:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Todo> getTodos()
```

It returns data as a JSON array of objects:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "task": "Wake up",
        "dueDate": null,
        "completed": null
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "task": "Shower",
        "dueDate": null,
        "completed": null
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "task": "Drive to work",
        "dueDate": null,
        "completed": null
    }
]
```

The great thing about Spring MVC is that it provides these capabilities out of the box.
