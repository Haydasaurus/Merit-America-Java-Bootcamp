# Introduction to MVC

You've learned how to interact with an API from the client side, but what if you want to build an API for yourself or others to interact with?

Before you learn how to build APIs, you'll need to understand the problems that design patterns and frameworks solve. Imagine you launched a new startup that creates some of the best-designed coffee mugs marketed towards software developers. Initially, you sold your mugs on Etsy, but now it's time for you to expand your business.

You know you need to start with a web presence, so you build out a full-featured website that communicates with your database, customer relations management (CRM), and inventory management systems.

Eventually, you realize that your customers find you on their phones, so you want to make your products available on iOS and Android devices. The web application serves up its own user interface, so you end up starting from scratch and build out a mobile application for iOS and Android.

This process leaves you with three separate applications that share a lot of the same features. You could have avoided this issue with thoughtful planning.

You know that the common functionality of this application is on the server and that each application represents that data differently. A way to solve this problem is to create a single API that returns the data to the calling system. It's then up to each application to take that data and present it to the user in a way that best fits their screen size and device.

## What's MVC?

Applications can become large. As a result, it often becomes difficult to manage their size and complexity as new features emerge or existing requirements change. To address this, software developers rely on design patterns that assist in keeping the code clean and maintainable. One such pattern is **Model-View-Controller** (MVC).

MVC is a design pattern that separates an application into three main components:

1.  **M**odel
2.  **V**iew
3.  **C**ontroller

As programmers, the MVC pattern promotes loose coupling by helping to create applications so that the logic across web applications can be reused while not allowing any particular part to _do too much_.

### Models

Models are classes that represent the data in an application. Model classes define the properties of the data that you need to present, and provide the business logic and validation rules that must be enforced. Typically, models are retrieved from and stored in a database.

### Views

Views are the pieces of an application that display the user interface. A view is a template to present model data in one way or another.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: API views**
>
>The view in an API refers to the JSON that's returned to the client. The JSON is the data that's the content of your view. It's up to the different applications or views to display a representation of that data. You'll learn more about this in later units.

### Controllers

All incoming web requests from a client are routed to a controller that knows how to retrieve model data. The controller then determines how to return the data to the client and returns the appropriate view. You can think of controllers as mediators, as they facilitate communication between models and views. The following image depicts this process:

![Model-View-Controller](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176074056-e5fd2546-2fd8-4d32-a35a-3a22e4bb99c9.png)

### Bringing it together

Using Twitter as an analogy:

-   A single tweet or a list of tweets are the model.
-   A Twitter timeline, a single tweet page, and a Twitter thread are all different ways to display model data.
-   If you ask the Twitter API for a list of tweets, the controller returns the data in JSON format. It's up to each view to display the data.

## Separation of concerns

The MVC pattern helps to create apps that separate their different aspects:

-   UI logic exists within views.
-   Models contain business rules and validation.
-   The primary role of controllers is to facilitate communications between models and views.

This separation makes it possible for a team to break up the work. For example, one person can work on view code without interfering with work on the business logic.

# Introduction to Spring

It's important to understand that MVC is a design pattern and not a framework. Any language that wants to implement a framework based on the MVC design can do so, and you'll often find that multiple frameworks exists for each language.

The most popular MVC framework for Java is **Spring MVC**, which is part of the much larger [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) . Over the years, the Spring Framework has grown into a massive, enterprise-grade framework that goes well beyond its original intent of managing dependency injection.

You'll use a product called **Spring Boot** that simplifies using this large and complex framework. With Spring Boot, you can create stand-alone, production-grade, Spring-based applications.

## Request and response lifecycle

As mentioned in previous units, in a web-based client-server system, a client and a server exchange messages through HTTP requests and responses. Both web APIs and web applications reside in web servers and share many of the same characteristics and features.

One key distinction between the two is the payload contained in the HTTP responses. Web applications typically serve complete web pages, including all the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data needed to display a page. Web APIs, on the other hand, usually limit themselves to the data to complete a view. The view in terms of presentation is on the client; all it's missing is the data to display. The web API provides that data.

The following diagram is an illustration of the request and response lifecycle in a Spring MVC application:

![The flow and handling of HTTP packets within an MVC application](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176074810-352cf751-6bec-486a-88cb-03df54b4b88f.png)

1.  The clientâ€”such as a browserâ€”sends an HTTP request to the server.
2.  The server receives the HTTP request, converts it to a request object, and determines what controller action to forward the request to.
3.  The controller action receives the request.
4.  The controller creates a model (data) and performs any other needed logic.
5.  The controller creates the response object.
6.  The server converts the response object into the appropriate HTTP response and sends it back to the client.

Many things happen in this request and response lifecycle. Thankfully, Spring MVC does most of the work for you. In the next lessons, you'll focus on the controller and the model.

---

# Controllers

As mentioned earlier, you can think of controllers as mediators between models and views. As a go-between, controllers know what model to call to retrieve the data that's needed by the view.

This is what a basic controller class looks like using Spring MVC:

```java
package com.techelevator.todo.controllers;

@RestController
public class TodoController {

    private List<String> todos;

    public TodoController() {
        todos = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("Wake up", "Shower", "Drive to work"));
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<String> getTodos() {
        return todos;
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/todos/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String getTodo(@PathVariable int id) {
        return dao.getTodo(id);
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public void addTodo(String task) {
        if (task != null) {
            todos.add(task);
        }
    }

}
```

Hopefully, most of this looks familiar to you as there are classes, instance variables, constructors, and methods. What might not be familiar are the `@`-words scattered throughout the class. These are called **annotations**.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What's an annotation?**
>
>An **annotation** is a tag that's used to associate metadata with code blocks such as classes, methods, and variables. The compiler and runtime use this metadata to apply certain properties and features to the code block the annotation is used on. When an annotation is applied to a code block, the code is said to be "decorated" with the annotation.  
  >
>You can apply one or more annotations to nearly any block of code, but some annotations can only be applied to certain blocksâ€”for example, you can only use the `@RestController` annotation on a class. Annotations often have optional elements you can provide values for, like the `method` element of the `@RequestMapping` annotation in the example code.

The following sections describe the different parts that make up the controller code.

## Naming conventions

By convention, all of your controllers are contained in the same package, in this case, `com.techelevator.todo.controllers`. Although you can create the controller anywhere, convention says it's a good idea to organize them together in the same package, or namespace, so that other developers can immediately understand what this code does.

Now that you know where your controllers live, what should you name them?

The name of the class represents what resource it manages, such as User, Project, or Todo. It also contains the word "Controller" at the end. Here are a few good names for controllers:

-   `UserController.java`
-   `ProjectController.java`
-   `TodoController.java`

## Rest controller

However, the name of the controller isn't enough to indicate to Spring that this is a controller class. You must decorate the class with the `@RestController` annotation:

```java
@RestController
public class TodoController {

}
```

With the `@RestController` annotation in place, this class can receive incoming web requests.

## Handler methods

Controller methods annotated with `@RequestMapping` are called **handler methods**. There are two handler methods in this controller: one that returns a list of todos and one that adds a new todo:

```java
@RestController
public class TodoController {

    @RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<String> getTodos() {
        return todos;
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/todos/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String getTodo(@PathVariable int id) { //@PathVariable covered later in unit
        return dao.getTodo(id);
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public void addTodo(String task) {
        if (task != null) {
            todos.add(task);
        }
    }

}
```

## `@RequestMapping` elements

The `@RequestMapping` annotation has several elements that define which web requests the handler method responds to.

### `@RequestMapping(path=)`

The `path` element corresponds to the HTTP request path. In the example, both `getTodos()` and `addTodo()` are called for requests to the `/todos` request path.

### `@RequestMapping(method=)`

The `method` element specifies which HTTP request method, like `GET`, `POST`, or `PUT`, this handler method is used for.

#### `RequestMethod.GET`

The `RequestMethod.GET` argument specifies that the handler method runs when a `GET` request is received. The following code maps the `getTodos()` handler method to a `GET` request for `/todos`:

```java
  @RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
  public List<String> getTodos() {
      return todos;
  }
```

Visiting the path `/todos` calls the `getTodos()` method and returns the list of todos in JSON format:

```json
[
    "Wake up",
    "Shower",
    "Drive to work"
]
```

#### `RequestMethod.POST`

Like `RequestMethod.GET`, the `RequestMethod.POST` argument specifies that the handler method runs when a `POST` request is received. In this example, the `addTodo()` method is mapped to a `POST` request for `/todos`:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public void addTodo(String task) {
    //
}
```

>**âœ” Tip: Share the RequestMapping across handler methods**
>
Rather than redundantly specify the same path for all the handler methods, you can establish a shared base path by annotating the controller class.
>
>```java
>@RestController
>@RequestMapping("/todos") // Shared base path for all handler methods
>public class TodoController {
>
>    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
>    public List<String> getTodos() {
>        return todos;
>    }
>
>    // Extend the base path with an id parameter
>    @RequestMapping(path = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
>    public String getTodo(@PathVariable int id) { //@PathVariable covered later in unit
>        return dao.getTodo(id);
>    }
>
>    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)
>    public void addTodo(String task) {
>        if (task != null) {
>            todos.add(task);
>        }
>    }
>
>}
>```
>
>The base path may be extended on a method-by-method basis. For example, the `path="/{id}"` string in the `@RequestMapping(path="/{id}", ...)` extends the base path to `/todos/{id}` for the `getTodo()` handler method.

>**âœ” Tip: Specify a request method**
>
>If you don't specify an HTTP request method, a handler method maps to all request methods. So, it's best to be specific with your intentions.

# Models

In the example for the `getTodos()` method, the code returns a `List<String>`. This works well, but what happens when you want to represent data that's more than a basic string? For example, a `Todo` object could have the following properties:

-   id: `int`
-   task: `String`
-   dueDate: `LocalDateTime`
-   completed: `Boolean`

## What's a model?

In Java, a model is a class that represents the data of your application. Models often contain properties. They may also contain validation logic that enforces rules about the type of data the model can hold.

Here's an example model:

```java
package com.techelevator.models;

public class Todo {

    private int id;
    private String task;
    private LocalDateTime dueDate;
    private Boolean completed;

    public Todo() {

    }

    public Todo(int id, String task) {
        this.id = id;
        this.task = task;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    // ... The rest of the getters and setters ... //
}
```

Note the package name, `package com.techelevator.models`, in the code example. Much like controllers, models are typically collected in their own package.

## Using a model

A controller instantiates and populates the model. In most cases, when the application uses a database, the controller uses a **data access object** (DAO) to populate the model. Going back to the `TodoController`, you could replace the `List<String>` with `List<Todo>`:

```java
@RestController
public class TodoController {

    private List<Todo> todos;

    public TodoController() {
        Todo wakeup = new Todo(1,"Wake up");
        Todo shower = new Todo(2, "Shower");
        Todo drive  = new Todo(3,"Drive to work");
        todos = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(wakeup, shower, drive));
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Todo> getTodos() {
        return todos;
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public void addTodo(Todo todo) {
        if (todo != null) {
            todos.add(todo);
        }
    }
}
```

A `GET` request to `/todos` now returns a list of todos instead of the list of strings you saw before:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "task": "Wake up",
    "dueDate": null,
    "completed": null
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "task": "Shower",
    "dueDate": null,
    "completed": null
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "task": "Drive to work",
    "dueDate": null,
    "completed": null
  }
]
```

The benefit here is that you can use the same model when you're working with a list of Todos or when you want to get a specific todo:

```java
@RequestMapping("/todos/first", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Todo getTodo() {
    return todos.get(0);
}
```

A `GET` request to `/todos/first` returns the first todo in the list.

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "task": "Wake up",
    "dueDate": null,
    "completed": null
}
```

---

# Content negotiation

When the `getTodos()` method returns a `List<String>` or a `List<Todo>`, how does Spring MVC know to send JSON data in the HTTP response?

**Content negotiation** is an HTTP mechanism that's used for serving different formats of a resource at the same URL. The client specifies which formats it can understand in the `Accept` header of the HTTP request. JSON is the default format for Spring MVC.

For example, here's the return type of `List<String>`:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public List<String> getTodos()
```

It returns data as a JSON array of strings:

```json
[
    "Wake up",
    "Shower",
    "Drive to work"
]
```

Here's the return type of `List<Todo>`:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Todo> getTodos()
```

It returns data as a JSON array of objects:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "task": "Wake up",
        "dueDate": null,
        "completed": null
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "task": "Shower",
        "dueDate": null,
        "completed": null
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "task": "Drive to work",
        "dueDate": null,
        "completed": null
    }
]
```

The great thing about Spring MVC is that it provides these capabilities out of the box.

# Model binding

Controllers work with data that comes from HTTP requests. For example, a path variable may provide a record ID, and posted form fields may provide values for the properties of the model. Writing code to retrieve each of these values and convert them from strings to Java types would be tedious and error-prone. Model binding automates this process.

The model binding system does the following:

-   Retrieves data from various sources such as path variables, the request body, and the query string.
-   Provides the data to controllers in method parameters and public properties.
-   Converts string data to Java types.
-   Updates properties of complex types.

By default, model binding gets data from the following sources in an HTTP request:

-   Query string parameters
-   The request path
-   The request body

## Query string parameters

There are times when you'll want to pass some information along to your API as part of the request. Imagine that you created a method in your Todo API where someone could retrieve all todos based on the completed status. You might use a query string parameter named `filter` with a value of `completed`. It would look like this:

```shell
# request parameter example
http://localhost:8080/todos?filter=completed
```

Suppose you have the following handler method, take notice of the `@RequestParam` annotation in the parameter list:

```java
@RequestMapping("/todos")
public List<Todo> getFilteredTodos(@RequestParam String filter) {
    if (filter != null) {
        return filterTodos(filter);
    }
    else {
        return todos;
    }
}
```

Model binding goes though the following steps after the routing system selects the handler method:

1.  Finds a parameter of `getFilteredTodos()` with the `@RequestParam` annotation, a string named `filter`.
2.  Looks at the query string and finds `filter=completed`. Name matching isn't case-sensitive.
3.  Sets the `filter` parameter to the string value of `"completed"`.

You can declare more than one request parameter:

```shell
# multiple request parameters example
http://localhost:8080/todos?filter=completed&limit=10
```

```java
@RequestMapping("/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Todo> getFilteredTodos(@RequestParam String filter,
                                   @RequestParam int limit) {
    if (filter != null) {
        // limit query param value is assigned to the variable limit
        // and converted to type int
        return filterTodos(filter, limit);
    }
    return todos;
}
```

The `limit` parameter is required by default, so if you don't pass a limit to the method, it throws an exception. If you want it to be optional, you can set the `@RequestParam` annotation's `defaultValue` element to a value to use when no `limit` is specified:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Todo> getFilteredTodos(@RequestParam String filter,
                                   @RequestParam(defaultValue = "10") int limit) {
    // The quotes around "10" for the defaultValue are required, conversion
    // to the int limit parameter is performed by model binding
    if (filter != null) {
        return filterTodos(filter, limit);
    }
    return todos;
}
```

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Handling parameters with different names**
>
>What if a request parameter name doesn't follow Java naming conventions? For example, what if instead of `limit` the request parameter was named `todo_limit`? To match that request parameter with a method parameter that has a different name, use the `name` property of `@RequestParam` like this: `@RequestParam(name = "todo_limit", defaultValue = "10") int limit`

## Request path

What about a scenario where you want to find a specific todo by its ID? You could use a query string parameter for thatâ€”like `/todos?id=1`â€”but a popular REST convention is to use the ID as a part of the request path:

```shell
# request path variable example
http://localhost:8080/todos/2
```

That request says, "Get the todo where its ID is `2`."

This handler method would be called for that request, take notice of the `@PathVariable` annotation in the parameter list:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Todo getTodo(@PathVariable int id) {
    for (Todo todo : todos) {
        if (todo.getId() == id) {
            return todo;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

Model binding goes though the following steps after the routing system selects the handler method:

1.  Finds a parameter of `getTodo()` with the `@PathVariable` annotation, an `int` named `id`.
2.  Looks at the path of the HTTP request and finds "2" in the position labeled `{id}` in the `@RequestMapping` annotation.
3.  Converts the string "2" into the `int` value `2`.

## Request body

Earlier, you saw a `Todo` model that looked like this:

```java
public class Todo {

    private int id;
    private String task;
    private LocalDateTime dueDate;
    private Boolean completed;

    public Todo() {

    }

    public Todo(int id, String task, LocalDateTime dueDate, Boolean completed) {
        this.id = id;
        this.task = task;
        this.dueDate = dueDate;
        this.completed = completed;
    }

    // getters, setters & toString
}

```

You could send a request with query string parameters needed to create a new `Todo`, but as you can see in the following code, writing a method with so many annotated parameters quickly becomes cumbersome:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public void addTodo(@RequestParam int id,
                    @RequestParam String task,
                    @RequestParam @DateTimeFormat(iso = DateTimeFormat.ISO.DATE_TIME) LocalDateTime dueDate,
                    @RequestParam Boolean completed) {
    todos.add(new Todo(id, task, dueDate, completed));
}
```

Not to worryâ€”there's a better way to handle this. You can use the `@RequestBody` annotation to have the request body read and deserialized into an object:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public void addTodo(@RequestBody Todo todo) {
    todos.add(todo);
}
```

With that method in place, you can now send a `POST` request with JSON data:

![Add Todo - POST JSON](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/179303485-88c79ae9-9158-4a6b-beb5-5c02f8c3765e.png)

Spring creates a new `Todo` object and calls its setters with values from the properties of the JSON object that have the same names.

# Quiz

## **Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 1**

**In Spring MVC, which of the following class definitions is a valid controller?**

â—‹ 
```java
@ApiController
public class MyController {}
```

â—‰ 
```java
@RestController
public class MyController {}
```

â—‹ 
```java
public class MyController extends ApiController {}
```

â—‹ 
```java
public class MyController extends RestController {}
```

**Explanation:** A controller needs to be given the @RestController annotation.


## **Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 2**

**Which of the following request mapping annotations allows the method to respond to a request for a list of users at endpoint `http://localhost:8080/users`?**

â—‹ `@RequestMapping(path = "/", method = RequestMethod.GET)`

â—‹ `@RequestMapping(path = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)`

â—‰ `@RequestMapping(path = "/users", method = RequestMethod.GET)`

â—‹ `@RequestMapping(path = "/users/list", method = RequestMethod.GET)`

**Explanation:** This method responds to a GET at `http://localhost:8080/users`.


## **Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 3**

**What makes it possible for the `list()` and `create()` handler methods to be available at the same URL?**

```java
@RestController
public class EmployeeController {

    @RequestMapping(path = "/employees", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Employee> list() {

    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/employees", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public void create(@RequestBody Employee employee) {

    }

}
```

â—‰ The HTTP method name is different for each endpoint

â—‹ The two handlers have different parameter types

â—‹ The two handlers have different names

â—‹ The return type is different between the two handlers

**Explanation:** The URL and the HTTP method, specified in the `method` property of the `@RequestMapping` annotation, determine which requests a handler method responds to. The `list()` method runs for `GET` requests, and the `create()` method runs for `POST` requests.


## **Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 4**

**Based on the URL `http://localhost:8080/employees?department=hr`, which of the following allows you to filter employees by department?**

â—‹ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees/department", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(@PathVariable String filter)
```

â—‹ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(@PathVariable String department)
```

â—‹ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees/{department}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(@PathVariable String department)
```

â—‰ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(@RequestParam String department)
```

**Explanation:** `@RequestParam` gives you access to the URL query string parameters.


## **Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 5**

**Based on the URL `http://localhost:8080/books/23`, which of the following allows you to retrieve the book with the ID 23?**

â—‹ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/books", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Book getBook(@RequestBody int id)
```

â—‹
