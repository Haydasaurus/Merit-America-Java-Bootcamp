# Model binding

Controllers work with data that comes from HTTP requests. For example, a path variable may provide a record ID, and posted form fields may provide values for the properties of the model. Writing code to retrieve each of these values and convert them from strings to Java types would be tedious and error-prone. Model binding automates this process.

The model binding system does the following:

-   Retrieves data from various sources such as path variables, the request body, and the query string.
-   Provides the data to controllers in method parameters and public properties.
-   Converts string data to Java types.
-   Updates properties of complex types.

By default, model binding gets data from the following sources in an HTTP request:

-   Query string parameters
-   The request path
-   The request body

## Query string parameters

There are times when you'll want to pass some information along to your API as part of the request. Imagine that you created a method in your Todo API where someone could retrieve all todos based on the completed status. You might use a query string parameter named `filter` with a value of `completed`. It would look like this:

```shell
# request parameter example
http://localhost:8080/todos?filter=completed
```

Suppose you have the following handler method, take notice of the `@RequestParam` annotation in the parameter list:

```java
@RequestMapping("/todos")
public List<Todo> getFilteredTodos(@RequestParam String filter) {
    if (filter != null) {
        return filterTodos(filter);
    }
    else {
        return todos;
    }
}
```

Model binding goes though the following steps after the routing system selects the handler method:

1.  Finds a parameter of `getFilteredTodos()` with the `@RequestParam` annotation, a string named `filter`.
2.  Looks at the query string and finds `filter=completed`. Name matching isn't case-sensitive.
3.  Sets the `filter` parameter to the string value of `"completed"`.

You can declare more than one request parameter:

```shell
# multiple request parameters example
http://localhost:8080/todos?filter=completed&limit=10
```

```java
@RequestMapping("/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Todo> getFilteredTodos(@RequestParam String filter,
                                   @RequestParam int limit) {
    if (filter != null) {
        // limit query param value is assigned to the variable limit
        // and converted to type int
        return filterTodos(filter, limit);
    }
    return todos;
}
```

The `limit` parameter is required by default, so if you don't pass a limit to the method, it throws an exception. If you want it to be optional, you can set the `@RequestParam` annotation's `defaultValue` element to a value to use when no `limit` is specified:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Todo> getFilteredTodos(@RequestParam String filter,
                                   @RequestParam(defaultValue = "10") int limit) {
    // The quotes around "10" for the defaultValue are required, conversion
    // to the int limit parameter is performed by model binding
    if (filter != null) {
        return filterTodos(filter, limit);
    }
    return todos;
}
```

## Note: Handling parameters with different names

What if a request parameter name doesn't follow Java naming conventions? For example, what if instead of `limit` the request parameter was named `todo_limit`? To match that request parameter with a method parameter that has a different name, use the `name` property of `@RequestParam` like this: `@RequestParam(name = "todo_limit", defaultValue = "10") int limit`

## Request path

What about a scenario where you want to find a specific todo by its ID? You could use a query string parameter for that—like `/todos?id=1`—but a popular REST convention is to use the ID as a part of the request path:

```shell
# request path variable example
http://localhost:8080/todos/2
```

That request says, "Get the todo where its ID is `2`."

This handler method would be called for that request, take notice of the `@PathVariable` annotation in the parameter list:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Todo getTodo(@PathVariable int id) {
    for (Todo todo : todos) {
        if (todo.getId() == id) {
            return todo;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

Model binding goes though the following steps after the routing system selects the handler method:

1.  Finds a parameter of `getTodo()` with the `@PathVariable` annotation, an `int` named `id`.
2.  Looks at the path of the HTTP request and finds "2" in the position labeled `{id}` in the `@RequestMapping` annotation.
3.  Converts the string "2" into the `int` value `2`.

## Request body

Earlier, you saw a `Todo` model that looked like this:

```java
public class Todo {

    private int id;
    private String task;
    private LocalDateTime dueDate;
    private Boolean completed;

    public Todo() {

    }

    public Todo(int id, String task, LocalDateTime dueDate, Boolean completed) {
        this.id = id;
        this.task = task;
        this.dueDate = dueDate;
        this.completed = completed;
    }

    // getters, setters & toString
}

```

You could send a request with query string parameters needed to create a new `Todo`, but as you can see in the following code, writing a method with so many annotated parameters quickly becomes cumbersome:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public void addTodo(@RequestParam int id,
                    @RequestParam String task,
                    @RequestParam @DateTimeFormat(iso = DateTimeFormat.ISO.DATE_TIME) LocalDateTime dueDate,
                    @RequestParam Boolean completed) {
    todos.add(new Todo(id, task, dueDate, completed));
}
```

Not to worry—there's a better way to handle this. You can use the `@RequestBody` annotation to have the request body read and deserialized into an object:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/todos", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public void addTodo(@RequestBody Todo todo) {
    todos.add(todo);
}
```

With that method in place, you can now send a `POST` request with JSON data:

![Add Todo - POST JSON](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/e6c65d3f0d29b47b4d7ef603206135f1.png)

Spring creates a new `Todo` object and calls its setters with values from the properties of the JSON object that have the same names.
