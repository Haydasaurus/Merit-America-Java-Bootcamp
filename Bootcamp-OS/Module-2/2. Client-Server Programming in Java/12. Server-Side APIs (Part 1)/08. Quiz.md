**Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 1**

In Spring MVC, which of the following class definitions is a valid controller?

○ 
```java
@ApiController
public class MyController {}
```

◉ 
```java
@RestController
public class MyController {}
```

○ 
```java
public class MyController extends ApiController {}
```

○ 
```java
public class MyController extends RestController {}
```

**Explanation:** A controller needs to be given the @RestController annotation.

**Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 2**

Which of the following request mapping annotations allows the method to respond to a request for a list of users at endpoint `http://localhost:8080/users`?

○ `@RequestMapping(path = "/", method = RequestMethod.GET)`

○ `@RequestMapping(path = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)`

◉ `@RequestMapping(path = "/users", method = RequestMethod.GET)`

○ `@RequestMapping(path = "/users/list", method = RequestMethod.GET)`

**Explanation:** This method responds to a GET at `http://localhost:8080/users`.

**Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 3**

What makes it possible for the `list()` and `create()` handler methods to be available at the same URL?

```java
@RestController
public class EmployeeController {

    @RequestMapping(path = "/employees", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Employee> list() {

    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/employees", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public void create(@RequestBody Employee employee) {

    }

}
```

◉ The HTTP method name is different for each endpoint

○ The two handlers have different parameter types

○ The two handlers have different names

○ The return type is different between the two handlers

**Explanation:** The URL and the HTTP method, specified in the `method` property of the `@RequestMapping` annotation, determine which requests a handler method responds to. The `list()` method runs for `GET` requests, and the `create()` method runs for `POST` requests.

**Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 4**

Based on the URL `http://localhost:8080/employees?department=hr`, which of the following allows you to filter employees by department?

○ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees/department", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(@PathVariable String filter)
```

○ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(@PathVariable String department)
```

○ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees/{department}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(@PathVariable String department)
```

◉ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Employee> getEmployeesByDepartment(@RequestParam String department)
```

**Explanation:** `@RequestParam` gives you access to the URL query string parameters.

**Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 5**

Based on the URL `http://localhost:8080/books/23`, which of the following allows you to retrieve the book with the ID 23?

○ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/books", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Book getBook(@RequestBody int id)
```

○ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/books/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Book getBook()
```

◉ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/books/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Book getBook(@PathVariable int id)
```

○ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/books", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Book getBook(@PathVariable Book book)
```

**Explanation:** The `@RequestMapping` path has variable `{id}`, and the method accepts it as an `@PathVariable int id`.

**Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 6**

Which of the following methods takes the request body and deserializes it into an `Employee` object?

○ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public void create(@RequestBody Employee employee)
```

◉ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees", method=RequestMethod.POST)
public void create(@RequestBody Employee employee)
```

○ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees/{employee}", method=RequestMethod.POST)
public void create(@PathVariable Employee employee)
```

○ 
```java
@RequestMapping(path="/employees", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public void create(@RequestParam Employee employee)
```

**Explanation:** The `@RequestBody` annotation gives you access to the body in a `POST` request.

**Server-Side APIs (Part 1) 7**

Consider this handler:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/blogs/{blogId}/posts", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public List<Comment> listPostsForBlog(@PathVariable int blogId) {
    ...

```

The client needs to get a list of customers with the last name _Johnson_. If the server is running at `http://localhost:8080`, to what URL does the client need to send a `GET` request?
