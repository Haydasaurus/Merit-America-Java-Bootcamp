# String Concatenation

So far in this unit, you've seen how to combine data from multiple **rows** in a result set into a single row. There are situations where you'll instead need to combine data from multiple **columns** in a result set into a single column. You can combine numbers from several columns into a single value with mathematical operators, but what about when columns contain strings?

## The string concatenation operator

In PostgreSQL, the string concatenation operator is `||`. Placing it between the names of two fields combines the contents of those fields into a single column in the result set. For example, assume you have a table of addresses like this:

| **street_number** | **street_name**    | **city**    | **state** | **zip** |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------- | ------- |
| 10101             | Wilshire Boulevard | Los Angeles | CA        | 90024   |
| 20                | West 34th Street   | New York    | NY        | 10001   |
| 7100              | Euclid Avenue      | Cleveland   | OH        | 44103   |

To retrieve a single column of the street addresses (street number and street name), you'd write a query like this:

```sql
SELECT street_number || ' ' || street_name AS street_address
FROM address
```

| **street_address**       |
| ------------------------ |
| 10101 Wilshire Boulevard |
| 20 West 34th Street      |
| 7100 Euclid Avenue       |

Note that the concatenation operator is used twice to include a space between the number and street name.

>**âœ” Tip: Use an alias**
>
>When combining fields with `||`, use an alias so the resulting column has a name.

You can combine any number of fields and literal strings with the concatenation operator, and you can include any number of concatenated columns in the query results. For example:

```sql
SELECT street_number || ' ' || street_name AS line_1,
       city || ', ' || state || ' ' || zip AS line_2
FROM address
```

| line_1                   | line_2                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| 10101 Wilshire Boulevard | Los Angeles, CA 90024 |
| West 34th Street         | New York, NY 10001    |
| 7100 Euclid Avenue       | Cleveland, OH 44103   |
