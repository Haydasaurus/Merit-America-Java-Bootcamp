# Introduction

As you've seen, SQL is built out of clauses that you can add onto statements and continue to refine the results you receive. Now, you'll learn about other clauses that help you refine them further.

# Ordering rows

By default, rows come back from the database in an unspecified order. It's up to the DBMS to decide how it returns rows from a `SELECT` statement. However, by adding an `ORDER BY` clause, you can set the order the database returns your rows in.

Look at the following statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY age;
```

This statement orders your results by the children's ages, but in what order? Youngest to oldest or oldest to youngest?

By default, all `ORDER BY` clauses are `ASC` or ascending, starting at the lowest value and going to the highest value. So if you're ordering by a number, the first row you get back has the lowest value, and the last row has the highest value. For strings, `a` is considered the lowest value, so `ASC` order goes from `a` to `z`, which means it's alphabetical.

Since `ASC` is the default order if one isn't specified, you could write the previous SQL statement like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY age ASC;
```

Now, imagine that you have the following rows in your database:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |

If you use the following statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY age ASC;
```

It gives you these results:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |

If you use this one:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY age DESC;
```

It gives you these results:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |

## Alphabetical sorting
If you use this statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY last_name ASC;
```

You'll get these results:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |

### Why aren't Nick and Adam alphabetical?
You ordered by `last_name` and now all the rows are sorted alphabetically by the `last_name` column. But shouldn't Adam be before Nick? Why would the database not sort that as well?

The answer is because you didn't tell it to. Computers only do what you tell them to do.

## Multiple `ORDER BY` clauses
In the SQL statement, you never defined that you wanted the `first_name` to be sorted too, so the database left it alone. However, you can fix that by changing your statement to say, "First, sort by `last_name`, then sort by `first_name`":

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;
```

This statement gives you these results:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |

Adding two columns to the `ORDER BY` clause indicates to the server that you want it to first sort by the first column and **_then_** sort by the second column.

In other words, this clause says to order by the children's last names first and then, **_if any of the last names are duplicates_**, order by those children's first names:

```sql
ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC
```

---

# Limiting the number of rows

You can also add another clause to your SQL to only return a certain number of rows, called the `LIMIT` clause. This can be useful for retrieving the top result of a query or for paging results from a SQL query.

If you want to retrieve the oldest child in the table, run this statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 1;
```

It gives you this result:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |

---

# Aggregating data

So far, you've been selecting rows of data from the database and returning it. But sometimes you might want additional **_information_** than the data itself provides.

For instance, you may want to know how many children are in the the `child` table. You could select them all with a `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child;
```

Then manually count the rows displayed:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |

But this isn't practical for large tables with many rows, and completely unnecessary thanks to **aggregate functions**.

## Aggregate functions

Instead of manually counting the rows, you can tell the database to count the rows like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM child;
```

Result:

| **count** |
| --------- |
| 4         |

Using these functions, you can collapse your data down into pieces of information. `COUNT(*)` tells you how many rows are returned from the statement.

You can use `WHERE` clauses to filter the data down too. If you run the following statement:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM child WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
```

It gives you this result:

| **count** |
| --------- |
| 2         |

So, `COUNT(*)` counts the number of rows.

There are some other aggregate functions, too.

`AVG(column)` returns the average value in a certain column:

```sql
SELECT AVG(age) FROM child;
```

| **avg** |     
| ------- | 
| 9.5     |   

`SUM(column)` adds up all the value from a certain column:

```sql
SELECT SUM(age) FROM child;
```

| **sum** |   
| ------- | 
| 38      |  

`MIN(column)` gives you the smallest value in that column:

```sql
SELECT MIN(age) FROM child;
```

| **min** |  
| ------- | 
| 8       | 

`MAX(column)` gives you the largest value in that column:

```sql
SELECT MAX(age) FROM child;
```

| **max** |  
| ------- | 
| 11      | 

---

# Grouping rows

What if you wanted to know how many children have the last name of Smith? You learned how to do this earlier:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child;
```

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM child WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
```

| **count** |
| --------- |
| 2         |

But what if you want to know how many children have **_each_** last name? Currently, you'd have to run a new statement per last name in the database, which you don't want to do.

If you want to aggregate data by a column in the table, you'd group rows together based on the column:

```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) FROM child GROUP BY last_name;
```

| **last_name** | **count** |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Smith         | 2         |
| Gold          | 1         |
| Claus         | 1         |

So what does `GROUP BY` do? It groups rows of data together that contain the same value so that you can aggregate them together.

This statement orders the database to group the rows by `last_name` from `child`:

```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) FROM child GROUP BY last_name;
```

Because there's no `WHERE` clause, it uses all the rows.

So first, the database gathers all the rows:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |

Next, it groups them by `last_name`:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |

And then collapses the rows down to just the `last_name` and the `COUNT(*)` from the `SELECT` clause, as you saw earlier.

| **last_name** | **count** |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Smith         | 2         |
| Gold          | 1         |
| Claus         | 1         |

Can you see who all has that `last_name`?

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) FROM child GROUP BY last_name;
```

Result:

```sql
ERROR: selected columns must be in GROUP BY clause
```

You can't select the first names because all the first names in the groups are different.

When the Smiths are grouped, you have the following rows in that group:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |

Selecting the `last_name` from that group as one data point is possible because they all have the same `last_name`, but selecting the `first_name` is harder. Which `first_name` do you choose? Nick or Adam?

You can only take one value, and the database doesn't know which one you want, so it doesn't even try. However, `COUNT(*)` takes those two rows and turns them into one value, so that works just as expected and returns a `2`:

| **last_name** | **count** |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Smith         | 2         |

`GROUP BY` is all about taking multiple rows and collapsing them down into one row. How you want them collapsed depends on what information you're trying to see.

## Grouping by multiple columns

So how can you get meaningful information from the pieces of data in your tables? Take the following `student` table as an example:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Monica         | Carlo         | PA        | Java      |
| Doug           | Marshal       | PA        | C#        |
| Greg           | Bishop        | OH        | C#        |
| Betty          | Raines        | OH        | Java      |
| Ted            | Dorsey        | PA        | Java      |
| Susan          | Granger       | PA        | C#        |

If you wanted to know how many students came from each state, you could write that as:

```sql
SELECT state, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY state ORDER BY state;
```

| **state** | **count** |
| --------- | --------- |
| OH        | 2         |
| PA        | 4         |

If you wanted to know how many students are in each class, you could write:

```sql
SELECT class, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY class ORDER BY class;
```

| **class** ** | count** |
| ------------ | ------- |
| C#           | 3       |
| Java         | 3       |

What if you wanted to see how many students from each state are in each class? For this, you can `GROUP BY` on two different columns:

```sql
SELECT state, class, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY state, class ORDER BY class, state;
```

This first gathers the rows and groups them by state:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Monica         | Carlo         | PA        | Java      |
| Doug           | Marshal       | PA        | C#        |
| Susan          | Granger       | PA        | C#        |
| Ted            | Dorsey        | PA        | Java      |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Greg           | Bishop        | OH        | C#        |
| Betty          | Raines        | OH        | Java      |

It then groups those groups into classes:

| **first_name** **last_name** | **state** | **class** |      |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---- |
| Monica                       | Carlo     | PA        | Java |
| Ted                          | Dorsey    | PA        | Java |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Doug           | Marshal       | PA        | C#        |
| Susan          | Granger       | PA        | C#        |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Greg           | Bishop        | OH        | C#        |
|                |               |           |           |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Betty          | Raines        | OH        | Java      |

And then runs the select to collapse these groups into one row each:

| **state** | **class** | **count** |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| PA        | Java      | 2         |
| PA        | C#        | 2         |
| OH        | C#        | 1         |
| OH        | Java      | 1         |

Finally you sort, first by class:

| **state** | **class** ** | count** |
| --------- | ------------ | ------- |
| PA        | C#           | 2       |
| OH        | C#           | 1       |
| PA        | Java         | 2       |
| OH        | Java         | 1       |

Then by state:

| **state** | **class** | **count** |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| OH        | C#        | 1         |
| PA        | C#        | 2         |
| OH        | Java      | 1         |
| PA        | Java      | 2         |

And there are the results.

# String concatenation

So far in this unit, you've seen how to combine data from multiple **rows** in a result set into a single row. There are situations where you'll instead need to combine data from multiple **columns** in a result set into a single column. You can combine numbers from several columns into a single value with mathematical operators, but what about when columns contain strings?

## The string concatenation operator

In PostgreSQL, the string concatenation operator is `||`. Placing it between the names of two fields combines the contents of those fields into a single column in the result set. For example, assume you have a table of addresses like this:

| **street_number** | **street_name**    | **city**    | **state** | **zip** |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------- | ------- |
| 10101             | Wilshire Boulevard | Los Angeles | CA        | 90024   |
| 20                | West 34th Street   | New York    | NY        | 10001   |
| 7100              | Euclid Avenue      | Cleveland   | OH        | 44103   |

To retrieve a single column of the street addresses (street number and street name), you'd write a query like this:

```sql
SELECT street_number || ' ' || street_name AS street_address
FROM address
```

| **street_address**       |
| ------------------------ |
| 10101 Wilshire Boulevard |
| 20 West 34th Street      |
| 7100 Euclid Avenue       |

Note that the concatenation operator is used twice to include a space between the number and street name.

>**✔ Tip: Use an alias**
>
>When combining fields with `||`, use an alias so the resulting column has a name.

You can combine any number of fields and literal strings with the concatenation operator, and you can include any number of concatenated columns in the query results. For example:

```sql
SELECT street_number || ' ' || street_name AS line_1,
       city || ', ' || state || ' ' || zip AS line_2
FROM address
```

| line_1                   | line_2                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| 10101 Wilshire Boulevard | Los Angeles, CA 90024 |
| West 34th Street         | New York, NY 10001    |
| 7100 Euclid Avenue       | Cleveland, OH 44103   |

# Quiz

## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 1**

**What's the default sort order when using `ORDER BY`?**

◉ `ASC`

○ `DESC`

○ There's no default; you have to specify the sort order

**Explanation:** If you don't specify a sort order, the default is `ASC` for ascending order.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 2**

**Which of the following do you use if you want only five rows returned from a query?**

○ `FIRST 5`

○ `TOP 5`

◉ `LIMIT 5`

○ `SELECT 5`

**Explanation:** The `LIMIT` clause lets you **_limit_** the number of rows returned by a query.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 3**

**Assume this data is in a table named `employee`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **department** | **state_of_residence** |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sarah          | Baker         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Gary           | Smith         | Marketing      | PA                     |
| Alice          | Woodard       | Engineering    | OH                     |
| Barb           | Green         | Engineering    | OH                     |
| John           | Smith         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Michael        | Baker         | Engineering    | OH                     |

**What's the last name of the employee in the first row returned by the following query?**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee
ORDER BY first_name;
```

○ Baker

○ Smith

◉ Woodard

○ Green

**Explanation:** Alice Woodard is the employee in the first row returned by the query because the query orders the results based on `first_name`.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 4**

**Assume this data is in a table named `employee`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **department** | **state_of_residence** |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sarah          | Baker         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Gary           | Smith         | Marketing      | PA                     |
| Alice          | Woodard       | Engineering    | OH                     |
| Barb           | Green         | Engineering    | OH                     |
| John           | Smith         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Michael        | Baker         | Engineering    | OH                     |

**What's the first name of the employee in the _second_ row returned by the following query?**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee
ORDER BY last_name DESC, first_name;
```

○ Sarah

◉ Gary

○ Alice

○ Barb

○ John

○ Michael

**Explanation:** Gary Smith is the employee in the second row returned by the query because the query orders the results based on `last_name` **_in reverse alphabetical order_** (DESC), then `first_name`. The last names in reverse alphabetical order are Woodard, Smith, Green, and Baker. John Smith and Gary Smith have the same last name, so the order by `first_name` sorts them in regular alphabetical order—Gary then John.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 5**

**Assume this data is in a table named `employee`:**

**How many rows are returned by the following query?**

```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*)
FROM employee
GROUP BY last_name;
```

**Answer:** 4

**Explanation:** There are four rows returned because the results are grouped by `last_name`, with a count of how many employees have that last name.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 6**

**Assume this data is in a table named `employee`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **department** | **state_of_residence** |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sarah          | Baker         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Gary           | Smith         | Marketing      | PA                     |
| Alice          | Woodard       | Engineering    | OH                     |
| Barb           | Green         | Engineering    | OH                     |
| John           | Smith         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Michael        | Baker         | Engineering    | OH                     |

**How many rows are returned by the following query?**

```sql
SELECT state_of_residence, department, COUNT(*)
FROM employee
GROUP BY state_of_residence, department;
```

**Answer:** 3

**Explanation:** There are three rows returned because the results are grouped by `state_of_residence` first, then grouped by `department`. There are three employees in PA and three employees in OH. The employees in each state are further grouped by `department`. Two PA employees are in the "Sales" department, and one is in the "Marketing" department. The three OH employees are all in the "Engineering" department.

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **department** | **state_of_residence** |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sarah          | Baker         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Gary           | Smith         | Marketing      | PA                     |
| Alice          | Woodard       | Engineering    | OH                     |
| Barb           | Green         | Engineering    | OH                     |
| John           | Smith         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Michael        | Baker         | Engineering    | OH                     |

**How do you concatenate the `first_name` and `last_name` columns together with a space between them?**

○ `SELECT first_name + ' ' + last_name FROM employee;`

◉ `SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name FROM employee;`

○ `SELECT first_name :: ' ' :: last_name FROM employee;`

○ `SELECT (first_name, ' ', last_name) FROM employee;`
