## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 1**

**What's the default sort order when using `ORDER BY`?**

◉ `ASC`

○ `DESC`

○ There's no default; you have to specify the sort order

**Explanation:** If you don't specify a sort order, the default is `ASC` for ascending order.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 2**

**Which of the following do you use if you want only five rows returned from a query?**

○ `FIRST 5`

○ `TOP 5`

◉ `LIMIT 5`

○ `SELECT 5`

**Explanation:** The `LIMIT` clause lets you **_limit_** the number of rows returned by a query.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 3**

**Assume this data is in a table named `employee`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **department** | **state_of_residence** |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sarah          | Baker         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Gary           | Smith         | Marketing      | PA                     |
| Alice          | Woodard       | Engineering    | OH                     |
| Barb           | Green         | Engineering    | OH                     |
| John           | Smith         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Michael        | Baker         | Engineering    | OH                     |

**What's the last name of the employee in the first row returned by the following query?**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee
ORDER BY first_name;
```

○ Baker

○ Smith

◉ Woodard

○ Green

**Explanation:** Alice Woodard is the employee in the first row returned by the query because the query orders the results based on `first_name`.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 4**

**Assume this data is in a table named `employee`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **department** | **state_of_residence** |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sarah          | Baker         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Gary           | Smith         | Marketing      | PA                     |
| Alice          | Woodard       | Engineering    | OH                     |
| Barb           | Green         | Engineering    | OH                     |
| John           | Smith         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Michael        | Baker         | Engineering    | OH                     |

**What's the first name of the employee in the _second_ row returned by the following query?**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee
ORDER BY last_name DESC, first_name;
```

○ Sarah

◉ Gary

○ Alice

○ Barb

○ John

○ Michael

**Explanation:** Gary Smith is the employee in the second row returned by the query because the query orders the results based on `last_name` **_in reverse alphabetical order_** (DESC), then `first_name`. The last names in reverse alphabetical order are Woodard, Smith, Green, and Baker. John Smith and Gary Smith have the same last name, so the order by `first_name` sorts them in regular alphabetical order—Gary then John.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 5**

**Assume this data is in a table named `employee`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **department** | **state_of_residence** |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sarah          | Baker         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Gary           | Smith         | Marketing      | PA                     |
| Alice          | Woodard       | Engineering    | OH                     |
| Barb           | Green         | Engineering    | OH                     |
| John           | Smith         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Michael        | Baker         | Engineering    | OH                     |

**How many rows are returned by the following query?**

```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*)
FROM employee
GROUP BY last_name;
```

**Answer:** 4

**Explanation:** There are four rows returned because the results are grouped by `last_name`, with a count of how many employees have that last name.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 6**

**Assume this data is in a table named `employee`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **department** | **state_of_residence** |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sarah          | Baker         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Gary           | Smith         | Marketing      | PA                     |
| Alice          | Woodard       | Engineering    | OH                     |
| Barb           | Green         | Engineering    | OH                     |
| John           | Smith         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Michael        | Baker         | Engineering    | OH                     |

**How many rows are returned by the following query?**

```sql
SELECT state_of_residence, department, COUNT(*)
FROM employee
GROUP BY state_of_residence, department;
```

**Answer:** 3

**Explanation:** There are three rows returned because the results are grouped by `state_of_residence` first, then grouped by `department`. There are three employees in PA and three employees in OH. The employees in each state are further grouped by `department`. Two PA employees are in the "Sales" department, and one is in the "Marketing" department. The three OH employees are all in the "Engineering" department.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 7**

**Select all the aggregate functions:**

	Select all correct options

■ `COUNT`

□ `LIMIT`

■ `MAX`

□ `GROUP`

**Explanation:** All of these are aggregate functions along with `MIN`, `AVG`, and others.


## **Ordering, Limiting, and Grouping 8**

**Assume this data is in a table named `employee`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **department** | **state_of_residence** |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sarah          | Baker         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Gary           | Smith         | Marketing      | PA                     |
| Alice          | Woodard       | Engineering    | OH                     |
| Barb           | Green         | Engineering    | OH                     |
| John           | Smith         | Sales          | PA                     |
| Michael        | Baker         | Engineering    | OH                     |

**How do you concatenate the `first_name` and `last_name` columns together with a space between them?**

○ `SELECT first_name + ' ' + last_name FROM employee;`

◉ `SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name FROM employee;`

○ `SELECT first_name :: ' ' :: last_name FROM employee;`

○ `SELECT (first_name, ' ', last_name) FROM employee;`
