# Quiz

## **Insert, Update, and Delete 1**

**What type of constraint ensures values in a column must reference an existing record in another table?**

○ Primary key

◉ Foreign key

○ Check constraint

○ Not null constraint

○ Unique constraint

**Explanation:** Foreign keys relate to data in other tables, and foreign key constraints enforce that the data must exist.


## **Insert, Update, and Delete 2**

**`INSERT` statements require the column names of the table.**

○ True

◉ False

**Explanation:** It's not required, but considered a good practice, to explicitly list the column names to make sure your values align with the correct columns.


## **Insert, Update, and Delete 3**

**What clause can you add to an `INSERT` statement to get the id for a newly inserted row?**

○ `SERIAL`

◉ `RETURNING`

○ `OUTPUT`

○ `WITH ID`

**Explanation:** A `RETURNING` clause added to the end of an `INSERT` statement returns the value specified in the clause.


## **Insert, Update, and Delete 4**

```sql
INSERT INTO person (person_id, last_name, middle_name, first_name)
VALUES (100, 'Howard', 'Lee', 'Scott');

SELECT first_name
FROM person
WHERE person_id = 100;
```

**What value would get returned from the `SELECT` statement?**

○ Howard

○ Lee

◉ Scott

**Explanation:** The column list in the `INSERT` statement has `first_name` as the last column, which the value `'Scott'` maps to.


## **Insert, Update, and Delete 5**

**Assume this data is in a table named `president`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **number** | **term_begin**        | **term_end** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| George         | Washington    | 1          | 1789-04-30            | 1797-03-04   |
| John           | Adams         | 2          | 1797-03-04            | 1801-03-04   |
| Thomas         | Jefferson     | 3          | 1801-03-04            | 1809-03-04   |
| James          | Madison       | 4          | 1809-03-04            | 1817-03-04   |
| James          | Monroe        | 5          | 1817-03-04\1825-03-04 |              |

**How many rows would remain in the table after the following statement runs?**

```sql
DELETE FROM president;
```

**Answer:** 0

**Explanation:** The statement has no `WHERE` clause so the statement deletes all rows in the table.


## **Insert, Update, and Delete 6**

**Assume this data is in a table named `president`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **number** | **term_begin**        | **term_end** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| George         | Washington    | 1          | 1789-04-30            | 1797-03-04   |
| John           | Adams         | 2          | 1797-03-04            | 1801-03-04   |
| Thomas         | Jefferson     | 3          | 1801-03-04            | 1809-03-04   |
| James          | Madison       | 4          | 1809-03-04            | 1817-03-04   |
| James          | Monroe        | 5          | 1817-03-04\1825-03-04 |              |

**How many rows would remain in the table after the following statement runs?**

```sql
DELETE FROM president
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';
```

**Answer:** 2

**Explanation:** The statement deletes all rows where `first_name` starts with the letter J—that's John Adams, James Madison, and James Monroe.


## **Insert, Update, and Delete 7**

**Assume this data is in a table named `president`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **number** | **term_begin**        | **term_end** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| George         | Washington    | 1          | 1789-04-30            | 1797-03-04   |
| John           | Adams         | 2          | 1797-03-04            | 1801-03-04   |
| Thomas         | Jefferson     | 3          | 1801-03-04            | 1809-03-04   |
| James          | Madison       | 4          | 1809-03-04            | 1817-03-04   |
| James          | Monroe        | 5          | 1817-03-04\1825-03-04 |              |

**If you run the following `UPDATE` statement:**

```sql
UPDATE president
SET first_name = 'Jim'
WHERE first_name = 'James'
AND number < 5;
```

**What value would get returned by the following `SELECT` statement?**

```sql
SELECT first_name
FROM president
WHERE last_name = 'Monroe';
```

**Answer:** James

**Explanation:** The `UPDATE` statement affects only James Madison, because the `WHERE` condition is `number < 5`.


## **Insert, Update, and Delete 8**

**Assume this data is in a table named `president`:**

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **number** | **term_begin**        | **term_end** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| George         | Washington    | 1          | 1789-04-30            | 1797-03-04   |
| John           | Adams         | 2          | 1797-03-04            | 1801-03-04   |
| Thomas         | Jefferson     | 3          | 1801-03-04            | 1809-03-04   |
| James          | Madison       | 4          | 1809-03-04            | 1817-03-04   |
| James          | Monroe        | 5          | 1817-03-04\1825-03-04 |              |

**If you run the following series of statements:**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE president
SET number = number * 2;

ROLLBACK;
```

**What value would get returned by the following `SELECT` statement?**

```sql
SELECT last_name
FROM president
WHERE number = 4;
```

**Answer:** Madison

**Explanation:** The `ROLLBACK` statement discards all data changes that occurred since the `BEGIN TRANSACTION` statement, so the `number` for James Madison is still 4.
