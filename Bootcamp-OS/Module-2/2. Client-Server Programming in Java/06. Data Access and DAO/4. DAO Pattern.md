# DAO pattern

The Java code in the previous examples demonstrates the fundamentals of database access with Spring JDBC. Using Spring JDBC in isolation, however, is just a linear sequence of Java statements without any real organization other than some clustering of related statements. There's nothing especially object-oriented about that approach. Fortunately, there's a useful and widely recognized way to organize your database access code.

One of the major outcomes of object-oriented programming has been the growth of **software design patterns**. While applications differ, they share many of the same challenges, such as accessing databases, logging audit information, and passing objects back and forth internally and in communication with other applications.

Over time, developers have created and shared descriptive solutions to these challenges. The solutions aren't code that you can drop into your application; rather they're templates with guidance on how to solve problems. Each template is a design pattern that offers a solution for a common challenge.

In particular, the **DAO pattern** is the one that can transform your database access code into something more useful.

**DAO** stands for **Data Access Object**, which is the name given to a set of classes and interfaces that facilitates interactions with a data source, as the following diagram shows:

![DAO pattern](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/6859fe3085f6930d4d2631c14753452f.png)

The first thing to notice in the diagram is the interaction between the application and the DAO. The application and DAO exchange models and values. The application can't detect what data sources lie on the other side of the DAO interface. If the application wants a piece of information, it calls one of the DAO's `GET` methods. If it wants to persist an object, it calls the DAO's `UPDATE` method. Since the application and the DAO are both written in Java, the models and values are Java models and values.

The various implementations of the DAO interface handle transforming and transferring the Java models and values back and forth with its underlying data source. The DAO pattern doesn't require any particular implementation of a DAO, and the "jdbc", "file", and "service" DAOs shown are only some of the possibilities.

As discussed previously, it's common to have models which map directly to database tables in JDBC, and in the DAO pattern, it's common to have separate DAOs for each model. For instance, `Book` and `Author` models have corresponding `BookDao` and `AuthorDao` interfaces. In turn, each DAO has at least one implementation based on a specific data source. In this case, the `bookstore` database, hence `JdbcBookDao` and `JdbcAuthorDao`.

As an example, the following code shows a DAO interface and JDBC implementation for the `Author` model which supports the CRUD operations, and a basic demonstration of using the `AuthorDAO` in an application.

```java
// AuthorDao.java
public interface AuthorDao {

    Author getAuthor(int authorId);

    List<Author> getAllAuthors();

    Author createAuthor(Author author);

    boolean updateAuthor(Author author);

    void deleteAuthor(int authorId);

}

// JdbcAuthorDao.java
public class JdbcAuthorDao implements AuthorDao {

    private final JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    public JdbcAuthorDao(DataSource dataSource) {
        jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
    }

    @Override
    public Author getAuthor(int authorId) {
        Author author = null;
        String sql =
            "SELECT author_id, first_name, last_name FROM author " +
            "WHERE author_id = ?;";
        SqlRowSet results = jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(sql, authorId);
        if (results.next()) {
            // Only expect one book, so a single if-next() confirms
            author = mapRowToAuthor(results);
        }
        return author;
    }

    @Override
    public List<Author> getAllAuthors() {
        List<Author> authors = new ArrayList<>();
        String sql = "SELECT author_id, first_name, last_name FROM author;";
        SqlRowSet results = jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(sql);
        while (results.next()) {
            // Only expect one book, so a single if-next() confirms
            authors.add(mapRowToAuthor(results));
        }
        return authors;
    }

    @Override
    public Author createAuthor(Author author) {
        String sql = "INSERT INTO author (first_name, last_name) " +
                     "VALUES (?, ?)  RETURNING author_id;";
        int authorId =
            jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(sql, Integer.class, author.getFirstName(),
                author.getLastName());
        // Set the authorId attribute of the Author object to the authorId returned.
        author.setAuthorId(authorId);
        return author;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean updateAuthor(Author author) {
        String sql = "UPDATE author SET first_name = ?, last_name = ? " +
                     "WHERE author_id = ?;";
        int numberOfRows =
            jdbcTemplate.update(sql, author.getFirstName(), author.getLastName(),
                author.getAuthorId());
        return numberOfRows == 1;
    }

    @Override
    public void deleteAuthor(int authorId) {
        // Delete foreign key references to authorID
        String deleteBookSql = "DELETE FROM book WHERE author_id = ?;";
        jdbcTemplate.update(deleteBookSql, authorId);
        // Now safe to delete the author
        String deleteAuthorSql = "DELETE FROM author WHERE author_id = ?;";
        jdbcTemplate.update(deleteAuthorSql, authorId);
    }

    private Author mapRowToAuthor(SqlRowSet results) {
        Author author = new Author();
        author.setAuthorId(results.getInt("author_id"));
        author.setFirstName(results.getString("first_name"));
        author.setLastName(results.getString("last_name"));
        return author;
    }
}

// BookstoreApp.java
public class BookstoreApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BookstoreApp bookstoreApp = new BookstoreApp();
        bookstoreApp.run();
    }

    private void run() {

        // Instantiate datasource and set connection string
        BasicDataSource dataSource = new BasicDataSource();
        dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bookstore");
        // Set connection credentials
        dataSource.setUsername("postgres");
        dataSource.setPassword("postgres1");

        // Create an instance of JdbcAuthorDAO
        AuthorDao authorDao = new JdbcAuthorDao(dataSource);

        // List all the authors
        System.out.println("All authors");
        List<Author> authors = authorDao.getAllAuthors();
        for (Author author : authors) {
            System.out.println(author);
        }

        // Display a single author
        System.out.println("\nAuthor Id:1");
        Author author = authorDao.getAuthor(1);
        System.out.println(author);

        // Create a new author
        System.out.println("\nCreate new author");
        Author newAuthor = new Author();
        newAuthor.setFirstName("Andre");
        newAuthor.setLastName("Norton");
        newAuthor = authorDao.createAuthor(newAuthor);
        System.out.println(newAuthor); // The authorID attribute will be displayed

        // Delete the new author using their authorId
        authorDao.deleteAuthor(newAuthor.getAuthorId());
        System.out.println("\nAuthor deleted");

    }
}
```

Note the use of the model objects, especially with the `create...()` and `update...()` methods. Not only is it more convenient to pass in the model object as a whole rather than the individual attributes as arguments, but a given instance of a model object corresponds to a row in the database, and the two must be maintained in sync.

What's also important here is returning the primary key value on `INSERT`, and updating the model object with the value in the `create...()` method. As for the `update...()` method, the model object passed in is assumed to contain all the necessary row values. In other words, the model object must be adjusted outside of the `update...()` method prior to calling the method.

Finally, the primary key attribute for a given instance of a model object is only set in the `create...()` and `mapRowTo...()` methods. That identifier is critical for keeping the model object and the database row it represents in sync with one another.

You can also see these best practices being applied in the unit tutorial which walks you through a full implementation of a DAO pattern.

## Best practices and the DAO pattern

The DAO pattern promotes many best practices and principles, some of which you're already familiar with:

-   **Encapsulation**: DAO classes contain all the logic for communicating with a database, and keep it separate from the rest of the application logic.
-   **Loose coupling**: The DAO interface abstracts away the specifics of the underlying data store, so that the application and data store have no knowledge of each other. The interface allows you to replace one implementation with another that accesses a different data source with little to no change to other code.
-   **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Organizing your code with the DAO pattern reduces duplication of the Spring JDBC code for communicating with the database and mapping data into objects.
