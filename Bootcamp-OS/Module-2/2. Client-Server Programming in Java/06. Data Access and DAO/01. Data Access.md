# Data access

You've learned that applications use relational databases to store data. You've also learned how to write SQL statements to read and modify data in a database. But how do Java applications interact with a database?

## Java data access layers

To perform interactions with a database—such as creating a connection and sending SQL statements—Java provides a stack of data access layers, as shown in the diagram:

![Data Access](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176063014-6653c0de-edc4-427f-9066-8825e013d7b6.png)

The lowest layer is the **Java Database Connectivity**, more commonly known as **JDBC**. JDBC is the API by which Java can access many different data sources including relational databases, spreadsheets, and flat files. There are two components to JDBC: the **JDBC Driver** and the API itself.

The API is database-neutral, meaning it's unaware of the specific underlying database. It submits SQL and retrieves results without detecting whether the database is PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, or something entirely different. To handle the difference between the neutrality of the API and a specific database, a JDBC Driver is inserted between the two.

Each database has its own JDBC Driver, or _database driver_. In other words, there are database drivers for PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and many more. The database driver is responsible for communication between the database-neutral API and the specific database the driver is intended for.

The selection and configuration of the database driver is typically addressed when you first create a Java project. The API is located in the Java packages `java.sql` and `javax.sql`. These packages can be imported into any class that needs to communicate with a database.

**Spring JDBC JdbcTemplate**

While JDBC allows Java applications to communicate with databases, its API requires you to manage many low-level details such as opening and closing database connections, handling exceptions, and transferring data between Java and the database. Writing code using the API can become tedious and error-prone.

Fortunately, Spring JDBC provides a class called the [`JdbcTemplate`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/JdbcTemplate.html) that makes working with SQL relational databases and JDBC much easier. `JdbcTemplate` abstracts away many of the details, which allows you to concentrate on your application's needs.

## Connection strings

Before you can send SQL statements to a database, you must set up a connection to the database. A connection provides a way for the database server and your application to communicate with each other.

You must have a **connection string** to establish the connection. A connection string contains information about the database. It follows a standard URL format:

```java
jdbc:postgresql://SERVER_NAME:PORT/DATABASE_NAME
```

-   `jdbc`: the protocol is JDBC.
-   `postgresql`: the driver name. (This curriculum uses PostgreSQL for Java.)
-   `SERVER_NAME`: the host name or IP address of the database server.
-   `PORT`: The port number of the database server.
-   `DATABASE_NAME`: the name of the database on the server.

The interface [`DataSource`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html) uses the connection string internally. Since `DataSource` is an interface, you must provide an implementation. One of the more popular implementations is the Apache Commons DBCP library [`BasicDataSource`](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/apidocs/org/apache/commons/dbcp2/BasicDataSource.html) . Once you create an instance of `BasicDataSource`, you need to bind your connection string to it using the `setURL()`.

In the following example, the application connects to a PostgreSQL database named `bookstore` at the beginning of `run()`:

```java
package com.techelevator;

import org.apache.commons.dbcp2.BasicDataSource;

public class BookstoreApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        BookstoreApp bookstoreApp = new BookstoreApp();
        bookstoreApp.run();

    }

    private void run() {

        // Instantiate datasource and set connection string
        BasicDataSource dataSource = new BasicDataSource();
        dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bookstore");

    }

}
```

### Security

Modern databases typically require credentials such as a username and password for all connections regardless of its source. However, if you look at the connection string example again, you'll notice there are no credentials included:

```java
jdbc:postgresql://SERVER_NAME:PORT/DATABASE_NAME
```

Set the connection credentials on the `dataSource` as the following code sample shows:

```java
private void run() {

    // ...
    dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bookstore");
    // Set connection credentials
    dataSource.setUsername("postgres");
    dataSource.setPassword("postgres1");

}
```

## Warning: Don't store plain text passwords in code

Storing plain text passwords in code isn't a good idea and is only done here to reduce complexity. There are ways to externalize these properties which you'll learn about later on.

## Connection objects

As mentioned earlier, Spring JDBC's `JdbcTemplate` helps with using JDBC, so create an instance immediately after setting up the `dataSource`:

```java
private void run() {

    // ...
    dataSource.setPassword("postgres1");

    // Create an instance of JdbcTemplate, and bind the datasource
    JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);

}
```

One of the key reasons for using `JdbcTemplate` over the lower-level APIs is that you don't have to concern yourself with managing the connections to the database. `JdbcTemplate` opens and closes any required connections whenever you perform a query or any other SQL action.
