# SQL statement parameters

So far, the examples have used static SQL, but imagine a scenario where a user wants to find records that match a certain condition. For instance, a user might want to find all the books written by Ted Chiang. The SQL query looks like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM book
JOIN author ON author.author_id = book.author_id
WHERE first_name = 'Ted' AND last_name = 'Chiang';
```

However, another user is interested in finding all of Ursula Le Guin's novels and collections:

```sql
SELECT * FROM book
JOIN author ON author.author_id = book.author_id
WHERE first_name = 'Ursula' AND last_name = 'Le Guin';
```

## Using SQL parameters

It's impractical to write static SQL statements for each author. SQL parameters are the answer.

If you need to insert one or more values into your SQL, you use question marks (`?`) to denote placeholders for the actual values:

```sql
SELECT * FROM book
JOIN author ON author.author_id = book.author_id
WHERE first_name = ? AND last_name = ?;
```

In this example, the `?`s are placeholders for the `first_name` and `last_name` values that are passed in from Java along with the SQL when calling `queryForRowSet()`:

```java
private void run() {

    // ...
    System.out.println("Book count: " + count);

    String authorBooksSql =
        "SELECT * FROM book " +
        "JOIN author ON author.author_id = book.author_id " +
        "WHERE first_name = ? AND last_name = ?;";
    // Include the author's first and last names to provide values for the placehalders
    SqlRowSet authorBooksResults =
        jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(authorBooksSql, "Ted", "Chiang");
    while (authorBooksResults.next()){
        Book book = mapRowToBook(authorBooksResults);
        System.out.println(book);
    }

}
```

You must supply a value for every placeholder in the SQL, even if they're repeating values. For instance, perhaps you're writing a query to find houses for sale within a certain price range. The seller has a low-high range, as does the buyer. The `WHERE` clause needs to find houses where the buyer's low-high overlaps the seller's range:

![Buyer's price range overlap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176064116-0da50d59-c4dd-4de8-aa00-d6c92fb1d2f5.png)

```java
String findHouseSql =
    "SELECT * FROM house " +
    "WHERE (? <= house.high_price AND ? >= house.low_price) AND (? < ?);";
SqlRowSet findHouseResults =
    jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(findHouseSql, buyerLow, buyerHigh, buyerLow, buyerHigh);
```

Since the SQL also validates that the buyer's low offer is less than their high offer, it contains four placeholders. The call to `queryForRowSet()` includes four values in addition to the SQL itself, two `buyerLow` values alternating with two `buyerHigh` values.

>This is discussed in a future unit, but using parameters is one way to prevent malicious users from using **SQL injection** to access data they shouldn't be able to, or even execute commands that can destroy your data.

>In addition, you also must remember to delimit strings, dates, and times with single quotes and to format dates and times correctly when building the concatenated SQL string. **_Note the single quotes around the `firstName` and `lastName` when building the previous `authorBookSQL` string._** Placeholders take care of these tasks for you.

## A second example: single row results

Another common use of placeholders is to retrieve a single record from a table using its primary key. There's nothing unusual with the placeholder in this example, but handling the results is different:

```
// Retrieving a single book by its primary key
String getBookByIdSql = "SELECT * FROM book WHERE book_id = ?;";
SqlRowSet bookResults = jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(getBookByIdSql, 6);
if (bookResults.next()) {
    // Only expect one book, so a single if-next() confirms
    Book book = mapRowToBook(bookResults);
    System.out.println(book);
}
else {
    // Zero books back from database -- how to handle depends upon context
    System.out.println("Book by id not found.");
}
```

When all the results from a query need to be processed, you use a `while` loop, but sometimes an `if (results.next())` is enough. An example might be when you only expectâ€”or only needâ€”one record to be returned, or when you need to know whether any results were returned, as is the case here. **_It's best to always confirm a matching record was found._**

## The final example: SQL `ILIKE` with wildcards, Java `List<>`, and nulls

This example demonstrates using wildcards with placeholders and SQL `ILIKE`, gathering up results in a Java `List<>` , and handling attributes which are potentially null.

In addition to retrieving books by the author's name, and a single book by its primary key, you want the users to be able to find book by titles using a search term. The search uses SQL `ILIKE` which ignores case and permits the use of wildcards. The search term is surrounded by wildcards in code such that "and" becomes "%and%" and matches "and" anywhere within a `book.title`:

```java
// Searching for book titles with wildcards
String findTitleSql = "SELECT * FROM book WHERE title ILIKE ?;";
// User search term is assumed to not have wildcards
String searchTerm = "and";
// Surround searchTerm with wildcards front-and-back`
String termWithWildcards = "%" + searchTerm + "%";
// "%and%" will be correctly wrapped with single-quotes by placeholder as '%and%'
SqlRowSet findTitleResults =
    jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(findTitleSql, termWithWildcards);
// Build a list of books rather than processing each book within the while-next() loop
List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();
while (findTitleResults.next()) {
    Book book = mapRowToBook(findTitleResults);
    // Add the book to the list
    books.add(book);
}
// The list is built, now do something with books on a book-by-book basis
BigDecimal totalPrice = new BigDecimal("0.00");
for (Book book : books) {
    // Since price column is nullable, make sure price attribute isn't null before adding
    if (book.getPrice() != null) {
        totalPrice = totalPrice.add(book.getPrice());
    }
    System.out.println(book);
}
System.out.println(totalPrice);
```

Building the `List<Book>` in code isn't any different than code you've encountered in the past. The only difference is that the call to `mapRowToBook` transforms the database row into a `Book` object.

Finally, since any nullable database column can potentially set its corresponding model reference type attribute to null, it's necessary to check `Big Decimal price` attribute for null before calling `add()`.
