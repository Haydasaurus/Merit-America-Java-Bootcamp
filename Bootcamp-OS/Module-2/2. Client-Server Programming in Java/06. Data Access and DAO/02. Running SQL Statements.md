# Running SQL statements

The examples given throughout the rest of this unit involve the `author` and `book` tables in the `bookstore` database. The following diagram shows the ERD for the database.

![Bookstore database](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176063092-e325b5b1-6bd7-4add-838f-77d5f748dc77.svg)

The relationship between the two tables is a one-to-many, with an author having from zero-to-many books, and a book always having one author.

## Submitting queries

Now that you can open connections to the database, you can send it SQL statements. There are various methods in the `JdbcTemplate` class you can use depending on what you want to do. The following are several of the most commonly used ones:

| Name               | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queryForRowSet()` | Execute a query for a SqlRowSet.                                                       |
| `queryForObject()` | Execute a query for a result object.                                                   |
| `update()`         | Execute a single SQL update operation (such as an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement). |

Imagine a scenario where a user wants to retrieve all of the books from the `book` table. To achieve this, you can use the `queryForRowSet()` method, which takes the SQL to execute as an argument:

```java
private void run() {

    // ...
    JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);

    /*
     Best practice is to assign the SQL string to a variable, and
     then pass the variable to the JdbcTemplate method.
     It makes for more readable and consequently maintainable code.
    */
    String sql = "SELECT book_id, title, author_id, " +
            "price, publish_date, out_of_print FROM book;";
    SqlRowSet results = jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(sql);

}
```

This returns a [`SqlRowSet`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/rowset/SqlRowSet.html) , which you use to iterate over the results.

## Reading query results

Reading the results from a `SqlRowSet` is like reading input from a `Scanner` in File I/O. You'll loop through the results in a `while` loop using the `next()` method of the `SqlRowSet`. When you call the `next()` method, the `SqlRowSet` moves to the next row of the result set. It returns `true` when it successfully moves to a row. It returns `false` if there are no more rows to read:

```java
private void run() {

    // ...
    SqlRowSet results = jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(sql);

    // Loop through all the rows returned
    while (results.next()) {

        // ...

    }
}
```

The `SqlRowSet` has many methods for retrieving column values from a row and converting them to the corresponding Java types. Each method takes the name of the column to retrieve. Most of the methods have self-explanatory names.

For instance, `getInt("book_id")` retrieves the value from the `book_id` column (a database `integer`) and returns a Java `int`. `getString("title")` does the same thing, but for the `title` column (a database `varchar`) and a Java `String`:

```java
private void run() {

    // ...
    SqlRowSet results = jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(sql);

    // Loop through all the rows returned
    while (results.next()) {

        // Simple mapping of columns to variables
        int bookId = results.getInt("book_id");
        String title = results.getString("title");
        int authorId = results.getInt("author_id");
        BigDecimal price = results.getBigDecimal("price");
        LocalDate publishDate = null;
        if (results.getDate("publish_date") != null) {
            publishDate = results.getDate("publish_date").toLocalDate();
        }
        boolean isOutOfPrint = results.getBoolean("out_of_print");
        System.out.println("Book{" +
                "id: " + bookId + ", title: " + title + ", price: " + price +
                "date published: " + publishDate + ", out of print: " + isOutOfPrint + "}");

    }

}
```

Two methods in the previous code sample need special mention: `getBigDecimal()` and `getDate()`:

```java
// ...
BigDecimal price = results.getBigDecimal("price");
LocalDate publishDate = null;
if (results.getDate("publish_date") != null) {
    publishDate = results.getDate("publish_date").toLocalDate();
}
// ...
```

### Money

The rounding problems inherent with floating-point values aren't limited to Java aloneâ€”they apply to databases as well. You must be careful whenever floating-point values represent money.

The preferred way to define "money" columns in PostgreSQL is to use the `numeric(precision, scale)` type with `precision` being the total number of digits, and `scale` being the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

## Note: Numeric precision and scale

The number of digits given in `scale` is included in the total number of digits, so the `book.price` column in the `bookstore` database defined as `numeric(10,2)` can contain a maximum value of 99,999,999.99.

The exact `precision` and `scale` varies from company to company. As a general rule, when defining maximum monetary values, err on the side of too large rather than too small.

`BigDecimal` is the preferred type for money amounts in Java, so the example code uses `getBigDecimal("price")` to retrieve the `numeric(10,2)` database value and convert it to a Java `BigDecimal`:

```java
BigDecimal price = results.getBigDecimal("price");
```

### Date and time

PostgreSQL has three date and time types:

| **Type**  | **Description**       |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| timestamp | both date and time    |
| date      | date (no time of day) |
| time      | time of day (no date) |

Fortunately, Java has corresponding `LocalDateTime`, `LocalDate`, and `LocalTime` types, and conversion methods appropriate for each type:

| **Database type** | **Java type** | **Conversion method** |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| timestamp         | LocalDateTime | toLocalDateTime()     |
| date              | LocalDate     | toLocalDate()         |
| time              | LocalTime     | toLocalTime()         |

Since the `getDate` method returns a `java.sql.Date`, the example code adds `.toLocalDate()` to `getDate("publish_date")` to convert that to a Java `LocalDate`:

```java
LocalDate publishDate = null;
if (results.getDate("publish_date") != null) {
    publishDate = results.getDate("publish_date").toLocalDate();
}
```

### Database nulls

As you know, database columns can contain null values if they're not defined as `NOT NULL`. This can result in Java throwing `NullPointerException`s if you aren't careful.

Look back at the previous ERD and note that `publish_date` allows nulls. If you call `toLocalDate()` directly on the Java `Data` object returned by `results.getDate("publish_date")`, you run the risk of calling the method on a null object and throwing a `NullPointerException`:

```java
LocalDate publishDate = results.getDate("publish_date").toLocalDate();
```

If the row's `publish_column` column has a null value, `getDate("publish_date")` returns null to Java. _You can't call methods on a null object._

To avoid the problem, always check for null if the column allows nulls in the database before calling a method on it:

```java
LocalDate publishDate = null;
if (results.getDate("publish_date") != null) {
    publishDate = results.getDate("publish_date").toLocalDate();
}
```

This isn't required if the value is assigned to a primitive data type, like `isOutOfPrint`:

```java
boolean isOutOfPrint = results.getBoolean("out_of_print");
```

Nulls are automatically converted to the primitive's zero-value.

## Mapping results to objects

The previous example shows the basic code to retrieve values from a database row, but having several disjointed variables isn't useful. It's difficult to keep them in sync so they contain the values from a single row. Passing around those variables also takes time. It would be less time-consuming and more object-oriented to store the values from a single row in a single object.

A common technique with JDBC is to create a model class representing a database table, and a mapping method which creates a new instance of the model, retrieves values from the `SqlRowSet`, assigns them to the attributes of the new instance, and then returns the fully instantiated object when complete.

### The "model" class

A model class is a POJO (plain old Java object) with attributes that match columns in the table it represents. A model class may also have additional attributes and methods for its own purposes.

For example, the `author` table has `author_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name` columns. Consequently, the `Author` model class has three attributes, `authorId`, `firstName`, and `lastName`, along with the getters and setters for each attribute, and a `toString` method:

```java
public class Author {

    // Private attributes that correspond to columns
    private int authorId;
    private String lastName;
    private String firstName;

    // ... public getters/setters not shown

    // Not required, but toString() override frequently added as a convenience
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Author{" + "authorId=" + authorID + ", lastName='" + lastName + '\'' + ", firstName='" + firstName + '\'' +  '}';
    }
}
```

The `book` model class isn't shown here, but it follows a similar construction as the `Author` class in terms of the correspondence between table columns and model attributes.

### Mapping method

The mapping method takes a `SqlRowSet` as its single argument. It creates a new instance of the model, sets the instance attributes with database values from the current row in the row set, and returns the fully instantiated object:

```java
private Book mapRowToBook(SqlRowSet results) {
    Book book = new Book();
    book.setBookId(results.getInt("book_id"));
    book.setTitle(results.getString("title"));
    book.setAuthorId(results.getInt("author_id"));
    book.setPrice(results.getBigDecimal("price"));
    if (results.getDate("publish_date") != null) {
        book.setPublishDate(results.getDate("publish_date").toLocalDate());
    }
    book.setOutOfPrint(results.getBoolean("out_of_print"));
    return book;
}
```

### Using the model and the mapping method together

The model and the mapper encapsulate their code which helps to clean up the application code when they're used together:

```java
private void run() {

    // ...
    SqlRowSet results = jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(sql);

    // Loop through all the rows returned
    while (results.next()) {

        // ...

        // Map a row to database model
        Book book = mapRowToBook(results);
        System.out.println(book);

    }

}
```

## Single value result

Occasionally, you may want only one value from the databaseâ€”perhaps the number of rows in a particular table, or the sum of a particular column.

If you want to get back a single object, you can use the `queryForObject()` method in the `JdbcTemplate` class. This method executes a query for and maps a single row or column to a given object type.

The following example selects the count of all the books in the book table, and returns the results as an `int` value:

```java
private void run() {

    // ...
    while (results.next()) {
        // ...
    }

    // Query for a single Integer value (Integer.class)
    int count = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject("SELECT count(*) FROM book;", int.class);
    System.out.println("Book count: " + count);

}
```
