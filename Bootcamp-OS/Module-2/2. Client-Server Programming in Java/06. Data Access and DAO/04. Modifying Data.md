# Modifying data

There's more to SQL than reading data. In addition to basic querying with `SELECT`, SQL offers `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements. Together, the four types of statements are frequently referred to as **CRUD** operations.

## Note: What is CRUD?

**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete are the four basic operations of persistent storage. In terms of SQL, here's how the operations match up:

| **CRUD operation** | **SQL statement** |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Create             | `INSERT`          |
| Read               | `SELECT`          |
| Update             | `UPDATE`          |
| Delete             | `DELETE`          |

## Create

The code for modifying SQL data follows the same outline that's been used with the previous `SELECT` examples: create the SQL string, and then call a `JdbcTemplate` method.

For `INSERT`, the SQL has a `RETURNING` clause so the value of the primary key of the new record is returned. To retrieve the primary key, `queryForObject()` is called, which transforms the value into an `int` with the `Integer.class` argument.

The example code is a bit longer than most:

```java
/*
 Add a new author and book to the database.
 It is a common practice to create and populate instances of a model
 prior to adding them to the database.
 */
Author author = new Author();
author.setLastName("Bester");
author.setFirstName("Alfred");
String createAuthorSql =
    "INSERT INTO author (first_name, last_name) VALUES (?, ?) RETURNING author_id;";
// Insert the new Author, and hold onto the returned auto-increment value of author_id
int authorId =
    jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(createAuthorSql, int.class, author.getFirstName(),
                                author.getLastName());
// Set the authorId attribute of the Author object to the authorId returned.
author.setAuthorId(authorId);
System.out.println(author);
/*
 Add a new book to the author just added.
 Note the use of the authorId to relate the book with the author.
 */
Book book = new Book();
book.setTitle("The Demolished Man");
book.setOutOfPrint(true);
book.setAuthorId(authorId); // Relate the author to the book by setting the authorId
String createBookSql =
    "INSERT INTO book (title, author_id, price, publish_date, out_of_print) " +
        "VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?) RETURNING book_id;";
// Insert the new book, and hold onto the returned auto-incremented value of book_id
int bookId =
    jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(createBookSql, int.class, book.getTitle(),
        book.getAuthorId(), book.getPrice(), book.getPublishDate(), book.isOutOfPrint());
// Set the bookId attribute of the Book object to the bookId returned
book.setBookId(bookId);
System.out.println(book);
```

In addition to creating a new author, the sample code also creates a new book, and demonstrates how the primary key returned by the `INSERT` of the author is used to relate the book to the author when the book is inserted into the `book` table.

There are several other things to note in the code sample. First, both the author and book inserts assume an instance of their respective models have been created and populated. As you'll see in the next lesson on the DAO pattern, model objects are a convenient way to pass in values when creating and updating the database.

Second, neither the `author.author_id` nor the `book.book_id` primary key column values are part of the `INSERT` statement. Both columns are defined as `SERIAL` in the database, so the database sets their values automatically. _Avoid providing values for auto-incremented columns overrides the values established by the database as this can lead to unexpected behavior._

Finally, the primary keys returned by the call to `queryForObject()` set the values for the `authorId` and `bookId` attributes of the `Author` and `Book` objects respectively since the auto-incremented values aren't known until after the insert.

## Update

The `price` attribute of the `book` object wasn't set in the prior example. The following example code fixes this:

```java
// Update the price and publish date of the newly added book
book.setPrice(new BigDecimal("11.10"));
book.setPublishDate(LocalDate.of(2013, 05, 28));
String updateBookSql =
    "UPDATE book SET title = ?, author_id = ?, price = ?, " +
        "publish_date = ?, out_of_print = ? WHERE book_id = ?;";
int numberOfRowsUpdated =
    jdbcTemplate.update(updateBookSql, book.getTitle(), book.getAuthorId(),
        book.getPrice(), book.getPublishDate(), book.isOutOfPrint(), book.getBookId());
// Since updated record using primary key, expect only one record updated.
if (numberOfRowsUpdated == 1) {
    System.out.println(book);
}
else {
    System.out.println("Update of book failed.");
}
```

It assumes the instance of the `book` model is still in scope and begins by setting its price attribute.

Next, it uses the `JdbcTemplate` method, `update()` which takes the SQL string, and as many values as there are placeholders in the SQL. This includes the `book.bookID` attribute as the last of the values passed in. It's used in the `WHERE` to limit the update to one record identified by its primary key. `update()` returns the number of rows updated. If no rows were changed, it returns zero. The `numberOfRowsUpdated` is checked to confirm just one record was updated.

## Delete

Performing a basic delete operation is similar to performing an update operation. Deleting can become more complex, however, when foreign key constraints are involved. For example, to remove an author from the bookstore database, you must first delete all the books related to the author in the `book` table because they have a foreign key constraint on `author_id`:

```java
// Delete the new author and any related books
String deleteBookSql = "DELETE FROM book WHERE author_id = ?;";
// Delete all the books related to the
int numberOfRowsDeleted = jdbcTemplate.update(deleteBookSql, author.getAuthorId());
// Safe to delete the author
String deleteAuthorSql = "DELETE FROM author WHERE author_id = ?;";
numberOfRowsDeleted = jdbcTemplate.update(deleteAuthorSql, author.getAuthorId());
if (numberOfRowsDeleted == 1) {
    System.out.println("Author was safely deleted");
}
else {
    System.out.println("Author delete failed.");
}
```

In other words, _you must always remove all foreign key references to a primary key in other tables before you can remove a record from a table where it's the primary key._ Due to the constraint, a crucial part of the following example is the order in which records are deleted.
