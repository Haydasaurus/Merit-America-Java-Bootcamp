# Introduction

Data is very valuable, so it's important that you protect the data in your applications from being stolen or lost. Considering that data breaches are a common occurrence, especially in web applications, learning some basic data security skills when working with a database is extremely important.

The topics you learn in this chapter are still major issues in a large number of web applications. Even experienced web developers may not pay attention to these issues. Major data security breaches have happened in banking, social media, and communications applications over the years. You can see some of the worst in this [Data Breach Visualization](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/) including over half a billion email accounts stolen from Yahoo in 2014 and multiple incidents involving Facebook.

So, how can you protect the information you've stored in a SQL database from outside attacks? There are a few ways to do this—some of which you've already learned.

# SQL injection

One of the main ways that data is stolen or destroyed in web applications is through an attack called a SQL Injection Attack. A SQL Injection attack is an attack where a malicious attacker passes a special value into your application that is executed by the database, causing it to retrieve or delete information that the attacker shouldn't have access to.

This is possible—as are all injection style attacks—because the value that makes the SQL bad doesn't affect the rest of the application at all.

## Example: accessing chat logs

Imagine that you're building a new application that handles corporate chat logs in a SQL database. Each chat message has the following information:

| **to** | **from** | **message**                                        |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Joe    | Chen     | Good morning. How was your weekend?                |
| Maria  | Joe      | Definitely planning to get that report done today. |
| Chen   | Maria    | Which accounts are being closed tomorrow?          |
| Maria  | Chen     | Accounts 1234, 5678, and 9012                      |

When Joe goes to his page, he can see his messages, or even search them. A SQL statement selects his messages given his search query like this:

```sql
SELECT to, from, message FROM messages WHERE (to='joe' OR from='joe') AND
    message LIKE '%morning%';
```

In the DAO, you could have a line like this:

```java
"SELECT to, from, message FROM messages WHERE (to='" + username +
    "' OR from='" + username + "') AND message LIKE '%" + search + "%'";
```

If the value of `username` is "Joe" and `search` is "morning", this would return these rows:

| **to** | **from** | **message**                         |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Joe    | Chen     | Good morning. How was your weekend? |

This application could run just fine for years without anyone knowing about how insecure this is. But imagine that a user has the ability to set that `search` to whatever they want. That's a reasonable expectation.

If Joe sets `search` to "report", he would get:

| **to** | **from** | **message**                                        |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Maria  | Joe      | Definitely planning to get that report done today. |

But he could set the search query to anything. If he knows how SQL works, he might send the following search:

```sql
O'Malley
```

This generates the SQL:

```sql
SELECT to, from, message FROM messages WHERE (to='Joe' OR from='Joe') AND
    message LIKE '%O'Malley%';
```

This causes a syntax error. It might even print an error message on the screen. This tells Joe that there's a problem in the SQL. Now, Joe can exploit it.

He could send the following search:

```sql
%' OR 1=1 --
```

While this looks like gibberish, it's actually a very carefully crafted attack. If that gets put into the SQL using concatenation and then sent to the SQL server, the statement looks like this:

```sql
SELECT to, from, message FROM messages WHERE (to='joe' OR from='joe') AND
    message LIKE '%%' OR 1=1 --%';
```

In other words, select messages where the to or from are "Joe" and the message is empty **or select everything**. That `1=1` is always going to be true, which means it always returns the row, and Joe gets to see all the messages:

| **to** | **from**                                        | **message**                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Joe    | Chen                                            | Good morning. How was your weekend?                |
| Maria  | Joe                                             | Definitely planning to get that report done today. |
| Chen   | Maria\Which accounts are being closed tomorrow? |                                                    |
| Maria  | Chen                                            | Accounts 1234, 5678, and 9012                      |

The `1=1` attack is a way for attackers to get every single record out of a database, whether they own it or not.

If Joe was malicious, he could even send a search like this:

```sql
%'; DELETE FROM messages; --
```

That runs the following statement:

```sql
SELECT to, from, message FROM messages WHERE (to='joe' OR from='joe') AND
    message LIKE '%%'; DELETE FROM messages; --%';
```

This empties the entire messages table from the database. Unless the site has a backup, the data is gone forever. Even if the site has a backup, it may require significant downtime to get everything back to the way it was.

All of this is happening because you're using one programming language to write another programming language. Injection attacks are possible because what is harmless in one language is destructive in the other. If the programmer isn't watching for it, it'll come back to bite them.

You can write this in your backend language and never cause a problem:

```sql
String search = "%'; DELETE FROM messages; --";
```

But if that string is included in a SQL statement, it can destroy a large part of your application.

## Preventing SQL injection attacks

As you can see, these kinds of attacks are bad news. So how do you protect yourself from them?

Luckily, you've already been taught how. When you saw how to generate SQL from Java, you saw what are called [prepared statements or parameterized statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement) . You should always use that approach, and never concatenate strings together to form a SQL statement.

### Spring Database `JdbcTemplate`

In Java, you have the `JdbcTemplate` class to use to make prepared statement calls to your database. By using SQL statements with `?` placeholders in them, you let the SQL database put the values into the SQL statement instead of doing it in Java. The SQL database knows how to merge these two values into a safe SQL statement that won't retrieve unauthorized information or destroy your data.

If you wrote your statement from before as a prepared statement, it would look like this:

```java
String sqlSearchMessages = "SELECT to, from, message FROM messages " +
    "WHERE (to=? OR from=?) AND message LIKE ?";
```

Then, you could call your SQL statement with the following code:

```java
SqlRowSet results = jdbcTemplate.queryForRowSet(sqlSearchMessages, username, username, "%" + search + "%");
```

How does this fix the problem? Because now you aren't building the whole SQL statement in your code. Instead, you're making your prepared statement, giving that to the server and then telling the server, "Put these values in the placeholders that are set up." Since the SQL server understands SQL, it can insert the values into the statement in a way that treats the value as a string and not as part of the statement.

Using prepared statements, if an attacker sent the string:

```sql
%'; DELETE FROM messages; --
```

The database wouldn't execute the `DELETE` statement, but would instead search for the literal string `%'; DELETE FROM messages; --` in the messages and, not finding any, return nothing.

# Data hashing

Keeping unauthorized users out of your database is a solid first step in keeping your data secure. But does that mean it's impossible to steal the data? What if someone who works at the company is offered large sums of money to steal the data? (It has happened.)

To protect data _after_ it's been stolen seems like an impossible task, but there are two ways to do this in applications: hashing and encryption. **Hashing** hides original data by scrambling it into something new, and **encryption** scrambles data in a way that can be reversible.

## Hashing

One way to hide data is by scrambling it so no one can recover it. This may sound like a bad idea, but it's useful in many different scenarios.

The way that you do that is by using a [Cryptographic Hash Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) . This is typically called hashing the value. Hashing is the process of taking a value, putting it through a repeatable mathematical function, and getting a different value out the other end.

It's important to note that if you only have the value that came out at the end, it's impossible to reverse the function and know what the original value was. These kind of algorithms are useful for verifying if the contents of a file have changed.

![Example hash use](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176065899-2b41eb92-c370-4442-b6c1-67c87251ff7e.png)

Even one small change to a file, like a letter change in the word 'over', completely changes the resulting hash value. It's also very fast. Even a large value can be passed into the function and have it compute a hash in a short amount of time.

Common uses of hashing includes:

-   Dropbox, who uses it to sync files. It keeps a database of file names and their hashes and then, when a file is updated, recomputes the hash to see if its contents have changed. That way, Dropbox only needs to upload files to their server if they've actually changed.
-   HashMaps and Dictionaries in Java and C#. When you put a value in, a hash of its key is calculated to see where in the backing data structure the value should go. This makes it possible to quickly find and store values instead of searching through an entire data structure to see if it's there.
-   Git uses hashes to track file changes and commits. A hash of a commit's contents and the current time is used to make sure all commits have a unique identifier.

An important way that web developers use hashing is by hashing passwords.

## Password hashing

Nearly all web applications have a concept of usernames and passwords. If you know a user's username and password, you can access all of their data on a website and act like them on the website. If someone was able to obtain someone's password on Dropbox, they would essentially have full access to that person's files.

So if someone was able to get the database of all Dropbox users, that would be a bad breach, right?

Not necessarily. In most web applications—and it should be all web applications—passwords aren't stored directly in the database. They're hashed first and then stored in the database. This means that even if someone got the database with all the usernames and password hashes, they still wouldn't be able to log in as those users.

So how do normal users log in? When they come to the site, they enter their original password and the application hashes it and checks that hash against what's in the database. If the two hashes match, the user is logged in.

Because the hashes are impossible to reverse, an attacker that has a database full of hashes would never be able to get the original passwords anyway.

## Hashing vulnerabilities

It is possible, with a weak hashing algorithm and a weak password, that an attacker could generate every possible combination of password and check those against a database of hashes. If a hash matches, the attacker knows that they can log in as that user.

This is especially true for short passwords. Using any character on a standard QWERTY keyboard, there are five hundred trillion possible eight-character passwords. Most users don't pick random passwords. They pick words, typically English words. The average person's vocabulary is 20,000 words. A user might make their password hard to guess by adding in a number or a special character, typically at the end.

However, modern CPUs and GPUs can calculate billions of hashes a second and run through all the possibilities of eight-character, word-like passwords.

In fact, it's already been done for a lot of common passwords. There are sites out there, like [HashToolkit](https://hashtoolkit.com/) , that have full databases of already calculated hash values. If you use a basic hash algorithm, attackers could upload your database to one of these sites and have plain passwords in no time. This is called a dictionary attack. A **dictionary attack** pre-computes the hash values of likely passwords and indexes the value. Given a hashed password, the hash is looked up to see if an entry exists in the dictionary. These dictionaries are also sometimes called **rainbow tables**.

If attackers already have access to vast amounts of pre-calculated hashes, how can you protect your users? These dictionaries are only useful for short passwords. The longer a password gets, the more possibilities it could have and the longer it would take to calculate all possibilities. So, you need to make each user's password longer before hashing it. You can do that with some salt.

## Salting passwords

A **salt** is a fixed-length, cryptographically strong random value. It's added to the end of the password to make the password longer and make it take more time to do a full dictionary attack. If every user gets a different salt, then attackers would have to calculate a full dictionary _per user_, making the time it takes to crack any password well outside the realm of reasonable time. A salt makes it practically impossible to pre-compute all possible hashes of a password, given that one character can change the entire output hash, let alone 6, 8, or 20. You can read more about [salting passwords](https://auth0.com/blog/adding-salt-to-hashing-a-better-way-to-store-passwords/) .

But processors can still tear through a large number of hashes in a second. At 500 billion passwords a second, an attacker could churn through all 500 trillion 8 character passwords in about 17 minutes. Another technique for solving this problem is to make the hashing process take longer.

## Adaptive Hashing functions and work factors

Many hashing functions are built to be fast. When Dropbox is calculating hashes of your files, you want that to happen as quickly as possible.

But for passwords, your application just needs to calculate the hash when the password is created and when the user logs in. If those hashes take a half a second to a second to calculate, what's the harm? If a hash takes a second per calculation for an attacker, they can forget trying to calculate enough of them to get any useful passwords out of the stolen data.

The nice thing about an adaptive hashing function is that you can change how long it takes to run. As computers get faster and hardware gets better, hashing functions can be calculated quickly. That means that, over time, you'll want to make your hashing functions slower. You do that with a work factor. A **work factor** is a setting on an adaptive hashing function that tells the function how many cycles of the hashing function to run. The more times it runs, the longer it takes. Also, if you ever need to make it run again, you increase the work factor, and your site is more secure.

Some example adaptive functions are _Argon2_, _PBKDF2_, _scrypt_, and _bcrypt_. Many languages support one of these algorithms already, so use the one that is included in whatever you're building.

# Encryption

The other way data can be safeguarded in a database or in transit is by using encryption. In cryptography, **encryption** is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it, and those who are not authorized cannot. You do this by using an encryption algorithm that takes a value—maybe a string or binary data—and scrambles it using some sort of key. There are two types of encryption used in applications: symmetric key encryption and asymmetric key encryption.

## Symmetric key encryption

Symmetric cryptography involves the parties sharing a common secret passphrase or key. Data is encrypted and decrypted using the same key.

This is commonly what people think of when they think of encryption. If you've ever encrypted a Zip file or PDF with a password, this is the kind of encryption being used.

![Symmetric Encryption](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176065940-3f3edfcb-f72a-4531-9e1e-e0dcd304402e.png)

Bob can write a message that he only wants Alice to see, so he encrypts it using symmetric encryption using a secret key that he created, typically a password. He then needs to get the now encrypted message to Alice and the password. Once Alice has the encrypted message and the password, she can decrypt the message and read the plain text again.

There are many different symmetric encryption algorithms in use today. Three well-known encryption algorithms are _DES_, _3DES_, and _AES_.

Symmetric encryption is great, but only if you can keep the secret key out of the hands of attackers. If Bob wants to send Alice a message, he needs to get her the encrypted message _and_ the password. That makes it hard to send along messages if the two users have no other way of communicating or have never met each other. That means for Internet communication, like passing encrypted information between an e-commerce site and a customer, symmetric encryption isn't very useful.

## Asymmetric key encryption

The type of encryption used in most Internet communication is called asymmetric encryption. **Asymmetric cryptography** is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: _public keys_ which may be disseminated widely, and _private keys_ which are known only to the owner.

![Asymmetric encryption](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176065972-0e892f82-b1e7-405b-8d8d-8553b07b3e61.png)

If a Bob wants to send a message to Alice now, he needs to get Alice's public key. This is something that Alice can freely give to anyone and happily sends it to Bob over email. Bob can then take the message and encrypt it using Alice's public key.

However, no one can decrypt the message using the public key. The encryption only happens in one direction. If a message is encrypted using a public key, only a related private key can decrypt it. Alice keeps the private key to herself and never gives that to anyone. When she gets a message encrypted with her public key, she can decrypt it and read what the message is.

This is how encryption works on the Internet. Amazon.com creates a pair of public and private keys. It sends the public key to anyone visiting the site. A user's browser then encrypts requests to Amazon with their public key and send that over the Internet. Amazon, however, is the only one that can read it because they're the only ones that have their private key.
