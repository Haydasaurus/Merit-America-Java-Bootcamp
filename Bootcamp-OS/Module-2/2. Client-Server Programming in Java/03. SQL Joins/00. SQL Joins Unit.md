# Primary and foreign keys

Before moving on to the next part of the `SELECT` statement, you'll learn about the relationships in your database.

Relational databases are about the links that you form between your tables and not just the data in them. The power of your databases comes from the fact that you can treat your data as discrete objects of data and then combine them to figure out information about the data.

For a concrete example, imagine that you had two tables in your database—a table of cities and a table of countries:

**country** 

| **country_id** | **name** |
| -------------- | -------- |
| 1              | Canada   |
| 2              | Mexico   |
| 3              | Cuba     |
| 4              | France   |
| 5              | Spain    |
| 6              | Italy    |
| 7              | China    |

**city**

| **city_id** | **country_id** | **name** |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1           | 6              | Milan    |
| 2           | 6              | Rome     |
| 3           | 7              | Beijing  |
| 4           | 4              | Nice     |
| 5           | 4              | Paris    |
| 6           | 1              | Toronto  |
| 7           | 5              | Seville  |

In these examples, the `country_id` column of the `country` table and `city_id` of the `city` table are **primary keys**. Primary key columns are columns that hold a value that's unique for every row in that table. Those are identifiers that you can use to get a specific row of data.

If you want to get the row from the country table that has `country_id` of 4, you know that you'll get back France. Since the `country_id` column is set up as the primary key—something that you add as a **constraint** on that table when you create it—you also know that each row's id is unique in that table.

The city table has a `city_id` column, which is the primary key for that table. There's also a column called `country_id`. That column is a **foreign key**. It references the country table and links a city to a certain country. By creating these primary and foreign keys, you can make your data truly relational and model how these two pieces of data link to each other in the real world.

# Cardinality

You know that cities and countries are related in real life. You also know that countries contain many cities, and a city is inside one country. There are a few different kinds of relationships that you'll want to model in your database. Here, you'll look at the most common two: one-to-many and many-to-many.

## One-to-Many

In the earlier example, the relationship between a city and a country is a **one-to-many** relationship. It can be expressed as, "A city is in only one country, and a country has many cities."

To model this in your SQL tables, you'd have a primary key on both tables and a foreign key on the table that has the _many_ part of the relationship—the city in this example.

![Cities and Countries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176061969-9fba7a7a-da56-446c-aead-cdf563ab4318.png)

Primary keys must be unique, but foreign keys don't have to be. Having a `country_id` on city means that many cities can have the same country. If you put a `city_id` on the `country` table, then a country could only have one city per row, which isn't what you want. So, because it's one country having many cities, you put the foreign key to country on the `city` table.

## Many-to-Many

But sometimes you want both sides of the relationship to be many. For example, if you want to model films and actors, you'd have a many-to-many relationship. You'd say, "An actor can be in many films, and a film can have many actors."

The question now is where the foreign key goes. If you put it on the `film` table, then a film could only have one actor. If you put it on the `actor` table, then an actor could only be in one film. Neither of those scenarios is what you want.

If you don't want the foreign key on the `film` table and you don't want it on the `actor` table, you must put it in its own table.

![Actors and Films](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176062042-a01a6250-41d1-4543-bdfa-ef451354b34f.png)

That `actor_film` table is a **join table** or an associative table. It's a required technique to join two tables together in a many-to-many relationship.

In the example, you still have primary keys on the `actor` and `film` tables, but then you put the foreign keys onto a new table called `actor_film`. So the `actor_film` table can have many rows with the same actor and many rows with the same film. This satisfies the need to link the `actor` and `film` tables together in a many-to-many relationship.

### Database naming conventions

You might wonder how to come up with these names for your tables and their rows. It's not random, but it's also not something set in stone either. Wherever you end up, the company most likely has a naming convention that they already follow.

The convention this book uses has the following features:

-   Tables usually relate to some object that you have in your application, like a city and a country. Table names are singular (city instead of cities), and "snake-cased"—meaning all lowercase letters, with words separated by underscore (as in `actor_film`).
-   Primary keys are usually integers and are usually named as `(tablename)_id`, as in `city_id` as the primary key for the `city` table.
-   Foreign keys usually have the same name as their matching primary key, which inherently states which table it comes from.
-   Join tables are the two table names concatenated together with a `_` in the middle, with the names arranged alphabetically, like `actor_film` and not `film_actor`.

Again, these aren't requirements, and you could see databases set up much differently than this. It's better to understand the concepts than to memorize the naming.

# Join clauses

So far, you've learned how to select data from a table in the database. Now, you'll learn how to select data from more than one table at a time. This is called **joining**. It's one of the most powerful ways that you can pull information from your databases.

Look again at the `city` and `country` tables:

**country**

| **country_id** | **name** |
| -------------- | -------- |
| 1              | Canada   |
| 2              | Mexico   |
| 3              | Cuba     |
| 4              | France   |
| 5              | Spain    |
| 6              | Italy    |
| 7              | China    |

**city**

| **city_id** | **country_id** | **name** |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1           | 6              | Milan    |
| 2           | 6              | Rome     |
| 3           | 7              | Beijing  |
| 4           | 4              | Nice     |
| 5           | 4              | Paris    |
| 6           | 1              | Toronto  |
| 7           | 5              | Seville  |

If you want to select all the cities in France, you'd write this:

```sql
SELECT name FROM city WHERE country_id=4;
```

That works, but only if you know that the id of France is 4. But what if you don't know that? What if you want to select all the cities by only knowing the name of the country?

You could write a statement that looks like this:

```sql
SELECT name FROM city 
WHERE country_id = (SELECT country_id from country WHERE name='France');
```

This query uses a **subquery**. You can use a subquery to run a `SELECT` statement inside another statement. The subquery runs first and pulls back the id of the country whose name is France. You can then use that in your other `SELECT` statement to pull back all the cities in that country. Now you don't have to hard code ids and memorize every id in your database.

But subqueries only work for so many things, and they're slow. It'd be best to use a `JOIN` clause for this type of query.

## Joining tables

You can write the previous query using a `JOIN` clause as well:

```sql
SELECT city.name FROM city
JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
WHERE country.name='France';
```

You can use `JOIN` clauses to join up the rows of one table to the rows of another table, essentially giving you a combined row of information that you can then select from.

Look again at the earlier `JOIN` clause:

```sql
FROM city JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
```

That clause gives you rows that look like this:

| **city_id** | **country_id** | **name** | **country_id** | **name** |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1           | 6              | Milan    | 6              | Italy    |
| 2           | 6              | Rome     | 6              | Italy    |
| 3           | 7              | Beijing  | 7              | China    |
| 4           | 4              | Nice     | 4              | France   |
| 5           | 4              | Paris    | 4              | France   |
| 6           | 1              | Toronto  | 1              | Canada   |
| 7           | 5              | Seville  | 5              | Spain    |

You've joined the two tables together where the `city.country_id = country.country_id`. You can see that the country can be duplicated, like for Milan and Rome, because more than one city has the same country.

Then you can select your columns from this new joined table. Since both `city` and `country` have a name column, you have to specify _which_ name column you want in the `SELECT` clause:

```sql
SELECT city.name FROM city
JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
```

Then, you only want the rows that have 'France' in the country:

```sql
SELECT city.name FROM city
JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
WHERE country.name = 'France';
```

That clause gives you these rows:

| **name** |
| -------- |
| Nice     |
| Paris    |

You could also change that statement to this:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(city.name, ', ', country.name) AS display_name FROM city
JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
WHERE country.name = 'France';
```

This is the result:

| **display_name** |
| ---------------- |
| Nice, France     |
| Paris, France    |

## Joining multiple tables

Think back to the actors and films example. From that example, imagine that you have an `actor` table that looks like this:

**actor**

| **actor_id** | **name**     |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 1            | Brad Pitt    |
| 2            | Bruce Willis |
| 3            | Chris Evans  |
| 4            | Alan Rickman |
| 5            | Ed Norton    |
| 6            | Tom Cruise   |

And `film`:

**film**

| **film_id** | **name**         |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | Die Hard         |
| 2           | Fight Club       |
| 3           | Moonrise Kingdom |
| 4           | 12 Monkeys       |

And, finally, the join table, `actor_film`:

**actor_film**

| **actor_id** | **film_id** |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| 2            | 1           |
| 4            | 1           |
| 5            | 2           |
| 1            | 2           |
| 5            | 3           |
| 2            | 3           |
| 1            | 4           |
| 2            | 4           |

Using this table, you can pull information about both actors and films by joining the tables together. If you wanted to get the name and all of the films from actors whose names start with 'B', you'd do the following:

```sql
SELECT actor.name, film.name FROM actor
JOIN actor_film ON actor_film.actor_id = actor.actor_id
JOIN film ON film.film_id = actor_film.film_id
WHERE actor.name LIKE 'B%';
```

| **name**     | **name**         |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Brad Pitt    | Fight Club       |
| Brad Pitt    | 12 Monkeys       |
| Bruce Willis | Die Hard         |
| Bruce Willis | Moonrise Kingdom |
| Bruce Willis | 12 Monkeys       |

You'll see that a lot of the values were duplicated, but each combination is unique. As the database joins the rows of different tables to each other, it creates as many rows as need to join all of the information.

When you select from `actor`, you only get two rows: `Brad Pitt` and `Bruce Willis`. But then you join the `actor_film` table on and the `film` table. Since Brad Pitt has been in two of the films, his name is attached to both of those rows and the value is duplicated. But that's okay. Each row has all the information you need from that call.

However, if you want to know how many movies each actor has been in, you'd need to write a different query.

First, you'd need to pull data from the `actor` table and join that to the `film` table:

```sql
FROM actor
JOIN actor_film ON actor_film.actor_id = actor.actor_id
JOIN film ON film.film_id = actor_film.film_id
```

You want to count the films, so if you group the rows by the actor, you can `COUNT` the number of films for each actor:

```sql
FROM actor
JOIN actor_film ON actor_film.actor_id = actor.actor_id
JOIN film ON film.film_id = actor_film.film_id
GROUP BY actor.actor_id, actor.name
```

And then you can select the actor's name and how many rows were returned for that actor:

```sql
SELECT actor.name, COUNT(*) AS num_of_films
FROM actor
JOIN actor_film ON actor_film.actor_id = actor.actor_id
JOIN film ON film.film_id = actor_film.film_id
GROUP BY actor.actor_id, actor.name
```

| **name**     | **num_of_films** |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Brad Pitt    | 2                |
| Bruce Willis | 3                |
| Alan Rickman | 1                |
| Ed Norton    | 2                |

Notice that Tom Cruise doesn't appear in the results. This is because he isn't linked in the database to any films. Since he isn't joined to any films, when you join the `actor_film` table in, his name disappears from the list. The same happens with Chris Evans.

# Outer joins

Take a look at the `city` and `country` tables again:

**country**

| **country_id** | **name** |
| -------------- | -------- |
| 1              | Canada   |
| 2              | Mexico   |
| 3              | Cuba     |
| 4              | France   |
| 5              | Spain    |
| 6              | Italy    |
| 7              | China    |

**city**

| **city_id** | **country_id** | **name** |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1           | 6              | Milan    |
| 2           | 6              | Rome     |
| 3           | 7              | Beijing  |
| 4           | 4              | Nice     |
| 5           | 4              | Paris    |
| 6           | 1              | Toronto  |
| 7           | 5              | Seville  |

You can join these tables to see countries and their cities:

```sql
SELECT country.name AS "Country", city.name AS "City"
FROM country 
JOIN city ON country.country_id = city.country_id;
```

These are the results:

| **Country** | **City** |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Italy       | Milan    |
| Italy       | Rome     |
| China       | Beijing  |
| France      | Nice     |
| France      | Paris    |
| Canada      | Toronto  |
| Spain       | Seville  |

Notice that the countries Mexico and Cuba are missing from the list. That's because there are no cities which reference those countries. The operation you performed is technically known as an **inner join**. For this type of join, the database returns a row for _every match_ of the rows in the first table (`country`) and second table (`city`). If there is no match, there is no row returned. So Cuba and Mexico drop out of the result.

When you specify `JOIN` in your SQL statement, you're asking for an inner join. It's the same as if you typed this:

```sql
FROM country 
INNER JOIN city ON country.country_id = city.country_id
```

But what if you want to see _all_ countries, regardless of whether there's a corresponding city in the database? For this, you use an **outer join**. For an outer join, you ask the database for _all_ the rows in one table (whether there is a match or not), plus the matching rows in another table.

SQL uses the terminology "left" and "right" to describe the two tables. SQL calls the _first_ table the _left_ table (the one named to the left of `JOIN`), and the _second_ table the _right_ table. If it helps, think of the entire SQL query as one long line of text. Then "left" and "right" makes some sense. If you want all the rows in the left table, you use a **left outer join**:

```sql
SELECT country.name AS "Country", city.name AS "City"
FROM country 
LEFT OUTER JOIN city ON country.country_id = city.country_id;
```

Now you see results that include the other two countries:

| **Country** | **City** |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Italy       | Milan    |
| Italy       | Rome     |
| China       | Beijing  |
| France      | Nice     |
| France      | Paris    |
| Canada      | Toronto  |
| Spain       | Seville  |
| Mexico      | (null)   |
| Cuba        | (null)   |

Mexico and Cuba are listed, but since there is no matching city, _the columns from the city table show null values_. This indicates that there was no match.

A **right outer join** applies the same principal, except that it returns all rows from the _right_ table (the table _after_ the `JOIN` clause), plus the matching rows from the left table.

What if you want to find all the countries which _do not_ have a city in the database? You can modify this query to test for null in a `city` column. You can test on any column in the `city` table, but it's best to use the primary key:

```sql
SELECT country.name AS "Country"
FROM country 
LEFT OUTER JOIN city ON country.country_id = city.country_id
WHERE city.city_id IS NULL;
```

Result:

| **Country** |
| ----------- |
| Mexico      |
| Cuba        |

□ 
```sql
SELECT timecard_id, employee_id, normal_hours
FROM timecard
WHERE employee_id = (SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = 'Sales')
```

□ 
```sql
SELECT timecard_id, employee_id, normal_hours
FROM timecard
WHERE employee_id = (SELECT employee_id FROM employee WHERE department = 'Sales')
```

■ 
```sql
SELECT timecard_id, employee_id, normal_hours
FROM timecard
WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM employee WHERE department = 'Sales')
```

□ 
```sql
SELECT tc.timecard_id, tc.employee_id, tc.normal_hours
FROM employee AS emp
JOIN timecard AS tc ON emp.department = 'Sales'
```

■ 
```sql
SELECT tc.timecard_id, tc.employee_id, tc.normal_hours
FROM timecard AS tc
JOIN employee AS emp ON tc.employee_id = emp.employee_id
WHERE emp.department = 'Sales'
```

**Explanation:** This request can be satisfied by joining the `employee` and `timecard` tables, or by using a sub-query. The sub-query selects a list of `employee_id`s in the Sales department, and the outer query selects rows from the `timecard` table whose `employee_id` is in that list.
