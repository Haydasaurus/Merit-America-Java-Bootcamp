**Which column represents the primary key in the `timecard` table?**

◉ timecard_id

○ employee_id

○ normal_hours

○ overtime_hours

**Explanation:** `timecard_id` is the primary key of the `timecard` table.


## **SQL Joins 4**

**Place the following SQL fragments into the proper order for execution by the DBMS:**

▤
```sql
SELECT employee.employee_id, employee.last_name, employee.first_name, wage.hourly_rate
```

▤
```sql
FROM employee
```

▤
```sql
JOIN wage
```

▤
```sql
ON
```

▤
```sql
employee.employee_id = wage.employee_id
```

▤
```sql
ORDER BY employee.last_name, employee.first_name
```


## **SQL Joins 5**

**Consider this database:**

![Payroll tables](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/e953d16f04b58823f645afcbc1330f12.png)

**What's the result of the following query?**

```sql
SELECT employee.employee_id, employee.first_name, timecard.normal_hours*2
FROM employee
JOIN timecard ON employee.employee_id = timecard.employee_id
WHERE employee.employee_id = 10002;
```

○ 10002 Chuck 36

○ 10002 Chuck 40

○ 10002 Chuck 45

◉ 10002 Chuck 80

○ 10002 80

**Explanation:** The query result lists the employee id, first name, and double the hours worked for employee 10002.


## **SQL Joins 6**

**Consider this database:**

![Payroll tables](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/e953d16f04b58823f645afcbc1330f12.png)

**How many rows will be returned by the following query?**

```sql
-- Show all employees and their timecards
SELECT emp.employee_id, emp.first_name, tc.normal_hours, tc.overtime_hours
FROM employee AS emp
JOIN timecard AS tc ON emp.employee_id = tc.employee_id;
```

○ 3

○ 4

◉ 5

○ 6

○ 9

**Explanation:** One row is returned for each match of `employee_id` in the `employee` table with `employee_id` in the `timecard` table. No row for employee 10004 is returned.


## **SQL Joins 7**

**Consider this database:**

![Payroll tables](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/e953d16f04b58823f645afcbc1330f12.png)

**How many rows are returned by the following query?**

```sql
-- Show all employees and their timecards
SELECT emp.employee_id, emp.first_name, tc.normal_hours, tc.overtime_hours
FROM employee AS emp
LEFT OUTER JOIN timecard AS tc ON emp.employee_id = tc.employee_id;
```

○ 3

○ 4

○ 5

◉ 6

○ 9

**Explanation:** For a `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, one row is returned for each row in the "left" table (`employee`), plus each match of `employee_id` in the `employee` table with `employee_id` in the `timecard` table. The result includes employee 10004, with `NULL` in the hours columns.


## **SQL Joins 8**

**Consider this database:**

![Payroll tables](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/e953d16f04b58823f645afcbc1330f12.png)

**You have been asked to list the `timecard_id`, `employee_id`, and `normal_hours` for all employees in the "Sales" department.**

Which of these queries satisfies this request?

	Select all correct options

□ 
```sql
SELECT timecard_id, employee_id, normal_hours
FROM timecard
WHERE employee_id = (SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department = 'Sales')
```

□ 
```sql
SELECT timecard_id, employee_id, normal_hours
FROM timecard
WHERE employee_id = (SELECT employee_id FROM employee WHERE department = 'Sales')
```

■ 
```sql
SELECT timecard_id, employee_id, normal_hours
FROM timecard
WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM employee WHERE department = 'Sales')
```

□ 
```sql
SELECT tc.timecard_id, tc.employee_id, tc.normal_hours
FROM employee AS emp
JOIN timecard AS tc ON emp.department = 'Sales'
```

■ 
```sql
SELECT tc.timecard_id, tc.employee_id, tc.normal_hours
FROM timecard AS tc
JOIN employee AS emp ON tc.employee_id = emp.employee_id
WHERE emp.department = 'Sales'
```

**Explanation:** This request can be satisfied by joining the `employee` and `timecard` tables, or by using a sub-query. The sub-query selects a list of `employee_id`s in the Sales department, and the outer query selects rows from the `timecard` table whose `employee_id` is in that list.
