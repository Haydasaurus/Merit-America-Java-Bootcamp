# SQL data types

One way that an RDBMS protects the consistency of your data is by specifying that data going into tables must match certain data types. In fact, each column defined on a table must have a data type in SQL databases. This data type verifies data going into tables and lets programmers know what kind of data comes out when retrieving data.

Most data types are either string or number data types. However, there can also be types for booleans, dates, and even very specific types, like IP addresses or geographic points and shapes.

The following tables shows the most common data types:

| Data type                          | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CHARACTER(n)                       | Character string. Fixed-length n                                                                                                             |
| VARCHAR(n) or CHARACTER VARYING(n) | Character string. Variable length. Maximum length n                                                                                          |
| BOOLEAN                            | Stores TRUE or FALSE values                                                                                                                  |
| SMALLINT                           | Integer numerical (no decimal). Precision 5                                                                                                  |
| INTEGER                            | Integer numerical (no decimal). Precision 10                                                                                                 |
| BIGINT                             | Integer numerical (no decimal). Precision 19                                                                                                 |
| DECIMAL(p,s)                       | Exact numerical, precision p, scale s. Example: decimal(5,2) is a number that has 3 digits before the decimal and 2 digits after the decimal |
| NUMERIC(p,s)                       | Exact numerical, precision p, scale s. (Same as DECIMAL)                                                                                     |
| DATE                               | Stores year, month, and day values                                                                                                           |
| TIME                               | Stores hour, minute, and second values                                                                                                       |
| TIMESTAMP                          | Stores year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values                                                                                     |

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Proprietary data types**
>
>Many SQL databases also have specific data types that are only in their proprietary databases. For example, PostgreSQL has a type called `SERIAL` that's an auto-incrementing integer used for unique values in a table. That data type doesn't exist in MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server.

These SQL data types allow you to be strict about what data goes into your tables. For example, it prevents a program from setting the user's age to "Frank" and breaking your application.

For SQL literals, you use single quotes (`'`) to denote all character type data, both strings and individual characters, as well as dates. So `'Frank'` is a valid string that you could put in a `VARCHAR` defined column. Numbers are just plain numbers, so `3.14` is a valid DECIMAL value.
