# Relational databases

Unless you specifically arrange to persist data in your application, it's lost when the program ends. Simple text files work well for many small applications, especially if there is a limited amount of data, and it doesn't have to be well-organized.

Business-oriented programs such as an online bookstore, on the other hand, typically require a more robust solution than a text file. Not only is the amount of data much larger, it also needs to be better organized to separate customers from publishers or books from shopping carts.

Business applications usually store their data in some type of **_database_**. A database is an organized collection of data that allows for quick retrieval and updates. Good databases are fast, persistent, and consistent. The databases you'll look at here are **relational databases**.

A relational database is a certain type of database that acts like an Excel spreadsheet. A relational database consists of tables that contain columns where each column has a name and a data type. You can then insert rows into those tables where each row specifies the data for a certain element.

Most databases contain many tables that all relate to each other. You can store data in those tables and retrieve it again at a later time.

These databases are managed in **Relational Database Management Systems** (RDBMS). An RDBMS is a computer application that manages the definition, storage, retrieval, and administration of these databases.

These database systems are used for many reasons:

1.  They support storing a large number of records, often in the millions of records, quickly and efficiently.
2.  They enable central storage of all of a company's data.
3.  They support a structured query syntax to retrieve, insert, and update data.
4.  They enforce consistency and integrity of data so data won't get lost or corrupted.

You'll use relational databases for your applications, and the **Structured Query Language**, or SQL, to work with them.

# SQL data types

One way that an RDBMS protects the consistency of your data is by specifying that data going into tables must match certain data types. In fact, each column defined on a table must have a data type in SQL databases. This data type verifies data going into tables and lets programmers know what kind of data comes out when retrieving data.

Most data types are either string or number data types. However, there can also be types for booleans, dates, and even very specific types, like IP addresses or geographic points and shapes.

The following tables shows the most common data types:

| Data type                          | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CHARACTER(n)                       | Character string. Fixed-length n                                                                                                             |
| VARCHAR(n) or CHARACTER VARYING(n) | Character string. Variable length. Maximum length n                                                                                          |
| BOOLEAN                            | Stores TRUE or FALSE values                                                                                                                  |
| SMALLINT                           | Integer numerical (no decimal). Precision 5                                                                                                  |
| INTEGER                            | Integer numerical (no decimal). Precision 10                                                                                                 |
| BIGINT                             | Integer numerical (no decimal). Precision 19                                                                                                 |
| DECIMAL(p,s)                       | Exact numerical, precision p, scale s. Example: decimal(5,2) is a number that has 3 digits before the decimal and 2 digits after the decimal |
| NUMERIC(p,s)                       | Exact numerical, precision p, scale s. (Same as DECIMAL)                                                                                     |
| DATE                               | Stores year, month, and day values                                                                                                           |
| TIME                               | Stores hour, minute, and second values                                                                                                       |
| TIMESTAMP                          | Stores year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values                                                                                     |

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Proprietary data types**
>
>Many SQL databases also have specific data types that are only in their proprietary databases. For example, PostgreSQL has a type called `SERIAL` that's an auto-incrementing integer used for unique values in a table. That data type doesn't exist in MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server.

These SQL data types allow you to be strict about what data goes into your tables. For example, it prevents a program from setting the user's age to "Frank" and breaking your application.

For SQL literals, you use single quotes (`'`) to denote all character type data, both strings and individual characters, as well as dates. So `'Frank'` is a valid string that you could put in a `VARCHAR` defined column. Numbers are just plain numbers, so `3.14` is a valid DECIMAL value.

# SQL statements

The Structured Query Language (SQL) is a declarative language. This means that it's a language where the developer defines what they want from the computer and not the step-by-step definition of what the computer must do, like in Java or other imperative languages.

There are three types of SQL statements:

-   The **Data Manipulation Language** (DML) that allows a programmer to insert, update, and delete data from the tables and select that data back out again.
-   The **Data Definition Language** (DDL) that allows a programmer to create new tables and define the data types of the columns on tables.
-   The **Data Control Language** (DCL) that allows a programmer to specify new users of the database and which tables and actions they have access to.

You'll start with the first of these SQL languages, DML, beginning with the `SELECT` statement.

## SELECT statements

To begin, you'll learn how to select data from a database. This is one of the main types of statements you'll use when developing a typical business application.

For these examples, assume that you have a database table that looks like this:

![Sample table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164797991-e347f40a-1773-42db-9c8c-a0799fec86ff.png)

In this database, the table would have a name. Here, it's called the `country` table. If you want to get the names of all the countries in the `country` table, you'd run the following statement:

```sql
SELECT name FROM country;
```

Result:

| **name**           |
| ------------------ |
| Cayman Islands     |
| Chile              |
| Cook Islands       |
| Costa Rica         |
| Djibouti           |
| Dominica           |
| Dominican Republic |
| Ecuador            |
| ...                |

This is a `SELECT` statement. All `SELECT` statements start with the keyword `SELECT` followed by the name of the column from which you want to retrieve data. After that's the `FROM` keyword, which specifies the table you want the data from. The database returns the value in the `name` column of _every_ row in the `country` table. These are called the `SELECT` clause and the `FROM` clause of the `SELECT` statement.

You can select more than one column from the table by separating each column name with a comma, as the following shows:

```sql
SELECT name, continent FROM country;
```

Result:

| **name**           | **continent** |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| Cayman Islands     | North America |
| Chile              | South America |
| Cook Islands       | Oceania       |
| Costa Rica         | North America |
| Djibouti           | Africa        |
| Dominica           | North America |
| Dominican Republic | North America |
| Ecuador            | South America |
| ...                | ...           |

There is also a shortcut for selecting all the columns of a table. That shortcut is to use the `*` symbol, which means _all_:

```sql
SELECT * FROM country;
```

Result:

| **code** | **name**           | **continent** | **region**      |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| CYM      | Cayman Islands     | North America | Caribbean       |
| CHL      | Chile              | South America | South America   |
| COK      | Cook Islands       | Oceania       | Polynesia       |
| CRI      | Costa Rica         | North America | Central America |
| DJI      | Djibouti           | Africa        | Eastern Africa  |
| DMA      | Dominica           | North America | Caribbean       |
| DOM      | Dominican Republic | North America | Caribbean       |
| ECU      | Ecuador            | South America | South America   |
| ...      | ...                | ...           | ...             |

You can use these two clauses to specify the data you want to select from the database. The `FROM` clause lets you specify what table you want to select from, and the `SELECT` clause lets you specify what columns you want to select from that table.

### Mathematical expressions
You can perform mathematical operations in SQL statements. You can either perform operations between columns, or a column and a literal:

```sql
-- add 3 to everybody's age
SELECT age + 3 FROM person;

-- calculate sales tax
SELECT subtotal * 0.05 FROM sale;

-- calculate total employee compensation (salary + bonus)
SELECT salary + bonus FROM employee;
```

You can write these expressions in the `SELECT` clause of statements, as shown here. You can also write them in `WHERE` clauses, which you'll learn about in the next lesson.

### Aliases
When using an expression in a `SELECT` statement, you'll often use an **alias** to give it a name. The expression needs a name like a column has a name. You use these names to access data in code, and you can't use it if it doesn't have a name.

To give an expression an alias, you use the `AS` keyword:

```sql
SELECT salary + bonus AS total_compensation FROM employee;
```

You can use an alias for any column. It doesn't have to be an expression:

```sql
SELECT name AS country_name FROM country;
```

In a later unit, you'll see other use cases for aliases.

# The WHERE clause

There are times when you don't want to select all the rows stored in a table. If you want to pick and choose which **_rows_** to pull back from the database, you need to use a `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM country WHERE continent = 'North America';
```

Result: 
| **code** | **name**           | **continent** | **region**      |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| CYM      | Cayman Islands     | North America | Caribbean       |
| CRI      | Costa Rica         | North America | Central America |
| DMA      | Dominica           | North America | Caribbean       |
| DOM      | Dominican Republic | North America | Caribbean       |
| ...      | ...                | ...           | ...             |

In defining a `WHERE` clause, you only extract the rows you want from the database. In this example, the database pulls rows where the data in continent is equal to 'North America.'

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Equality in SQL**
>
>In Java, you use double equals to see if two things are equal. In SQL, you use one equal.

## Conditionals

Specifying conditionals in `WHERE` clauses narrows down which rows to select from the database. Much like a conditional in an `if` statement, the `WHERE` clause conditional only selects rows where the conditional evaluates to true.

All of the standard conditionals that you already knowâ€”like `=`, `<`, `>`â€”are also available in SQL. There are some new ones too:

| **Operator**              | **Numbers**                                                               | **Characters**                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| =                         | Equal To                                                                  | Equal To                                                                  |
| <>, !=                    | Not Equal To                                                              | Not Equal To                                                              |
| <                         | Less Than                                                                 | Alphabetically Before                                                     |
| >                         | Greater Than                                                              | Alphabetically After                                                      |
| <=                        | Less Than or Equal                                                        | Alphabetically Before or Equal                                            |
| >=                        | Greater Than                                                              | Alphabetically After or Equal                                             |
| IN (value1, value2, ...)  | Is Value in List                                                          | Is Value in List                                                          |
| BETWEEN value1 AND value2 | Is Value Greater Than or Equal to value1 and Less Than or Equal to value2 | Is Value Greater Than or Equal to value1 and Less Than or Equal to value2 |
| IS NULL                   | Equal To Null                                                             | Equal To Null                                                             |
| IS NOT NULL               | Not Equal To Null                                                         | Not Equal To Null                                                         |
| LIKE '%value1%'           | N/A                                                                       | Contains value1                                                           |

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: `NULL` value in SQL**
>
>`NULL` has a different meaning in SQL than in other programming languages. In OOP languages such as Java, `NULL` means that a variable doesn't contain an object. In SQL, `NULL` means that a value hasn't been set on the column when the row was submitted. So a column is `NULL` if it doesn't have a value. For example, if you have a table of people and need to put Madonna or Cher in the table, the `last_name` column for those rows is `NULL`.

### The `IN` conditional

The `IN` conditional works like multiple `OR` conditions for one column and multiple values. For example, if you wanted to get people named Mary, Ted, or Alex, you'd write a query like this:

```sql
-- Get all people with the first name of Mary, Ted, or Alex
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE first_name IN ('Mary', 'Ted', 'Alex');
```

### The `BETWEEN` conditional

The `BETWEEN` conditional is like using a greater than or equal (`>=`) and a less than or equal (`<=`) together. This query is equivalent to using `WHERE age >= 18 AND age <= 34`:

```sql
-- Get all people whose age is between 18 and 34 (inclusive)
SELECT first_name, last_name, age FROM person WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 34;
```

You can also use `NOT` in front of `BETWEEN` to get all rows that aren't in a range:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, age FROM person WHERE age NOT BETWEEN 18 AND 34;
```

### The `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` conditionals

You can use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` to retrieve rows where a value is or isn't null:

```sql
-- Get all people who don't have a favorite color
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE favorite_color IS NULL;

-- Get all people who DO have a favorite color
SELECT first_name, last_name, color FROM person WHERE favorite_color IS NOT NULL;
```

### Using dates in conditionals

When you use a date in SQL, you surround it with single quotes like a string. Write dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

You can use dates in `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `IN`, and `BETWEEN` conditionals:

```sql
-- Get all people born on Jan 5, 1970, or later
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE birth_date >= '1970-01-05';

-- Get all people born between Jan 1, 1990 and Dec 31, 1999
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1999-12-31';
```

### The `LIKE` conditional

`LIKE` is a special conditional that only works with character data. It allows for "wildcard" searches. Look at the following SQL statement:

```sql
-- Get all last names that end in son
SELECT last_name FROM person WHERE last_name LIKE '%son';
```

This statement returns all rows where the `last_name` ends in `son`. The `%` is called a **wildcard**. It matches anything, so the preceding statement returns names like Erickson, Benson, and Danielson, but it won't return sonny or Wilsonn. The string must end in `son` because the `%` is at the beginning.

If you want to only get rows where the `last_name` _begins_ with `Ba`, write the following:

```sql
-- Get all last names that begin with Ba
SELECT last_name FROM person WHERE last_name LIKE 'Ba%';
```

If you want to only get rows where the `last_name` has the string `ski` anywhere in it, including having the string start with or end with `ski`, write the following:

```sql
-- Get all last names that contain ski anywhere
SELECT last_name FROM person WHERE last_name LIKE '%ski%';
```

### Combining conditionals with `AND` and `OR`

You can put conditionals together in a `SELECT` statement to get the rows you want.

For example, if you have a `person` table and want to get all the rows that represent children, you could write a statement like this:

```sql
-- Select all children from the database
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE age < 18;
```

You can also combine these conditionals using the keywords `AND` and `OR` to make more complex statements:

```sql
-- Select all the first names of children with a last name of Smith from the database
SELECT first_name FROM person WHERE age < 18 AND last_name = 'Smith';
```

# Unit summary

So far, you've learned a couple of different clauses that you can use to build SQL statements:

-   `SELECT` lets you define which columns you want to pull data from.
-   `FROM` lets you define which table you want to pull data from.
-   `WHERE` lets you define which rows you want to pull.

Many SQL statements use these three clauses. In the following units, you'll learn some other clauses that help you further refine your results.
