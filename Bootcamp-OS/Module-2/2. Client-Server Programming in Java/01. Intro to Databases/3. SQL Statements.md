# SQL statements

The Structured Query Language (SQL) is a declarative language. This means that it's a language where the developer defines what they want from the computer and not the step-by-step definition of what the computer must do, like in Java or other imperative languages.

There are three types of SQL statements:

-   The **Data Manipulation Language** (DML) that allows a programmer to insert, update, and delete data from the tables and select that data back out again.
-   The **Data Definition Language** (DDL) that allows a programmer to create new tables and define the data types of the columns on tables.
-   The **Data Control Language** (DCL) that allows a programmer to specify new users of the database and which tables and actions they have access to.

You'll start with the first of these SQL languages, DML, beginning with the `SELECT` statement.

## SELECT statements

To begin, you'll learn how to select data from a database. This is one of the main types of statements you'll use when developing a typical business application.

For these examples, assume that you have a database table that looks like this:

![Sample table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164797991-e347f40a-1773-42db-9c8c-a0799fec86ff.png)

In this database, the table would have a name. Here, it's called the `country` table. If you want to get the names of all the countries in the `country` table, you'd run the following statement:

```sql
SELECT name FROM country;
```

Result:

| **name**           |
| ------------------ |
| Cayman Islands     |
| Chile              |
| Cook Islands       |
| Costa Rica         |
| Djibouti           |
| Dominica           |
| Dominican Republic |
| Ecuador            |
| ...                |

This is a `SELECT` statement. All `SELECT` statements start with the keyword `SELECT` followed by the name of the column from which you want to retrieve data. After that's the `FROM` keyword, which specifies the table you want the data from. The database returns the value in the `name` column of _every_ row in the `country` table. These are called the `SELECT` clause and the `FROM` clause of the `SELECT` statement.

You can select more than one column from the table by separating each column name with a comma, as the following shows:

```sql
SELECT name, continent FROM country;
```

Result:

| **name**           | **continent** |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| Cayman Islands     | North America |
| Chile              | South America |
| Cook Islands       | Oceania       |
| Costa Rica         | North America |
| Djibouti           | Africa        |
| Dominica           | North America |
| Dominican Republic | North America |
| Ecuador            | South America |
| ...                | ...           |

There is also a shortcut for selecting all the columns of a table. That shortcut is to use the `*` symbol, which means _all_:

```sql
SELECT * FROM country;
```

Result:

| **code** | **name**           | **continent** | **region**      |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| CYM      | Cayman Islands     | North America | Caribbean       |
| CHL      | Chile              | South America | South America   |
| COK      | Cook Islands       | Oceania       | Polynesia       |
| CRI      | Costa Rica         | North America | Central America |
| DJI      | Djibouti           | Africa        | Eastern Africa  |
| DMA      | Dominica           | North America | Caribbean       |
| DOM      | Dominican Republic | North America | Caribbean       |
| ECU      | Ecuador            | South America | South America   |
| ...      | ...                | ...           | ...             |

You can use these two clauses to specify the data you want to select from the database. The `FROM` clause lets you specify what table you want to select from, and the `SELECT` clause lets you specify what columns you want to select from that table.
### Mathematical expressions
You can perform mathematical operations in SQL statements. You can either perform operations between columns, or a column and a literal:

```sql
-- add 3 to everybody's age
SELECT age + 3 FROM person;

-- calculate sales tax
SELECT subtotal * 0.05 FROM sale;

-- calculate total employee compensation (salary + bonus)
SELECT salary + bonus FROM employee;
```

You can write these expressions in the `SELECT` clause of statements, as shown here. You can also write them in `WHERE` clauses, which you'll learn about in the next lesson.

### Aliases
When using an expression in a `SELECT` statement, you'll often use an **alias** to give it a name. The expression needs a name like a column has a name. You use these names to access data in code, and you can't use it if it doesn't have a name.

To give an expression an alias, you use the `AS` keyword:

```sql
SELECT salary + bonus AS total_compensation FROM employee;
```

You can use an alias for any column. It doesn't have to be an expression:

```sql
SELECT name AS country_name FROM country;
```

In a later unit, you'll see other use cases for aliases.
