# HTTP and web services

An important concept of software development is having a fundamental understanding of how the internet works. You need to understand terms like "IP address" and concepts such as how a client and a server communicate. This information doesn't just pertain to how web pages are sent over the internet, but also how programs communicate with one another over the web.

# Terms to know

## URL

URL stands for **Uniform Resource Locator**. If you've ever used a web browser, you've probably seen a URL. This is the "address" of an online resource, like a website or a document. A basic URL contains the following parts:

![Basic URL Parts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176066196-5e5f0249-d66c-414a-85f9-50ee07304a38.png)

-   The **protocol** determines how your browser communicates with a web server. The two most common protocols are HTTP and HTTPS:
    -   **HTTP** stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
    -   **HTTPS** stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.
-   A **subdomain** is a sub-division of the main domain. For example, blog.example.com and mail.example.com are subdomains of the example.com domain.
-   A **domain name** is a unique reference that identifies a website on the internetâ€”for example, google.com.
-   The **TLD (Top Level Domain)** refers to the last part of the domain such as .net, .com, or .gov.

A more advanced URL might look like this and contain more parts:

### Port

A **port** number is rarely visible in URLs but always required. When declared in a URL, it comes after the TLD, separated by a colon. When it's not declared, the default port for the protocol is used. For HTTP, it's port 80; for HTTPS, it's port 443. You can think of a port as a specific door you'd use to enter a building. To use the website, you must enter door number 80 or door number 443.

### Path

The **path** typically refers to a file or directory on the web server, like `/directory/index.html`. The web server may use the path to serve resources that don't match the same physical path on the server.

For example, if the URL path is `/products/traffic-cones`, the physical file on the server may be something different, like `/pages/products/cones.html`. Whatever is at this path, whether it's something returned to the client or not, is often called a **resource** and is the "resource" in "Uniform Resource Locator", or URL.

### Query string parameters

The **query string parameters** are commonly found in the URL of dynamic pages, or pages that are generated from database or user-generated content. A question mark denotes the start of the query string, followed by one or more key-value pairs.

For example, the URL to search for cats on Google is https://www.google.com/search?q=cats, so the query string is `q=cats`. `q` is the key, and `cats` is the value. When there is more than one key-value pair, they're combined with an ampersand such as `q=cats&source=chrome`. The question mark is generally not considered to be part of the query string. It only denotes where the query string begins.

### Fragment

A **fragment** is an internal page reference, sometimes called a named anchor. You can think of it like a "bookmark" somewhere in the resource. It's typically used for allowing the web browser to automatically scroll to a specific part of a webpage.

>**âš  Warning: HTTPS encryption**
>
>HTTPS traffic is encrypted using **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**, which is a cryptographic protocol designed for secure computer communications, such as web browsing, email, or **Voice Over IP** (VOIP).
>
>While the path and query string are encrypted, it's still bad practice to include "sensitive" informationâ€”such as passwordsâ€”in these places. This information could be revealed in plaintext in a user's browser history or in server logs. TLS replaces the now-deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as those protocols were eventually broken.

## IP address

Imagine that you want to visit your friend at their house, and you use an online map service to get directions. The map service doesn't know what "Dave's house" is or where that is, but it can show you how to get to "742 Evergreen Terrace."

Computers and websites act the same way. Your computer doesn't know what `www.google.com` is or where that is, but it _does_ know how to get to `172.217.15.78`. That string of numbers is an **IP address**, and like your friend's address, that's how computers know how to get to other computers.

**IP** stands for Internet Protocol, and **address** refers to the unique location of a computer on the internet. There are two standards for IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6.

IPv4 addresses are often shown in the format like `93.184.216.34` where each groupâ€”called an octetâ€”is a 1-3 digit number between 0 and 255. The number of combinations allows IPv4 to support approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses, but many blocks of addresses are reserved for private networks like your Wi-Fi network at home, a company's intranet, or other special uses.

IPv6 is a newer version that allows for approximately 3.4x1038, or 340 trillion trillion addresses. An IPv6 address is often shown in the format like `2606:2800:0220:0001:0248:1893:25c8:1946` where each group contains four hexadecimal digits.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What is hexadecimal?**
>
>Hexadecimal is a number format where each digit can represent 16 different values, using the standard 0-9 for values zero to nine, and letters A through F for values ten to fifteen.
>
>While the world is slowly moving to IPv6, IPv4 is still widely prevalent and is used in this guide for the sake of simplicity.

### Domain Name System (DNS)

So how do computers translate domains like `google.com` to IP addresses like `172.217.15.78`? That's where the **Domain Name System** (DNS) comes into play.

When you type in a website URL, your computer connects to a DNS server, often one provided by your **Internet Service Provider**, or ISP, to do a lookup. You can think of DNS as a phone book for websites. You want to connect to `google.com`, and the DNS phone book tells you the IP address.

Just as a domain can have an IP address, subdomains can also have their own unique IP addresses. If `www.example.com` has an IP address of `192.168.23.17`, `blog.example.com` might have an IP address of `192.168.127.16`.

IP addresses for subdomains don't need to be "near" the IP address for the main domain, as it's common practice for companies to run a subdomain through a third party for services like a blog or mail server.

# HTTP communication

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (HTTP) was initially created for the transfer of "hypertext resources"â€”in other words, web pages.

Today, it's used for more than web pages. HTTP has become the basis for data-transfer over the internet. Even though this traffic doesn't only consist of web pages, it still uses some of the components that make up a URL. It all works the same way.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: HTTPS**
>
>This discussion applies to HTTPS as well. The only difference is that HTTPS is encrypted.

## HTTP request and response

HTTP communication consists of a **request** by a client, such as a web browser, and a **response** from a server. The following image depicts this process:

![Web Server HTTP Response and Request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176066287-fbbf20a1-d865-46f4-b31f-6bf698fefbcf.png)

A request message contains several elements, including:

-   An **HTTP method**, which is typically a verb like `GET` or `POST`. However, it can also be a noun, like `HEAD`. The method defines the desired action that the client wants to perform. See the [HTTP Methods](https://lms.techelevator.com/cohorts/94/blocks/28/content_files/01_Networking_and_HTTP/03-http-communication.md#http-methods) section for more information.
-   The path to the resource that the client wants to interact with. This can be the name of a file the client wants to receive or the location where the client wants to send data to.
-   Headers, which contain information about the request, such as the format of data sent or expected, whether to cache information, and authentication information.
-   A message body, typically used when the client sends data to the server.

A response message also contains several similar elements:

-   An **HTTP status code** that indicates success, error, or redirects the client to a different resource. You might be familiar with one of these status codes: `404` for file not found. See the [HTTP Status Codes](https://lms.techelevator.com/cohorts/94/blocks/28/content_files/01_Networking_and_HTTP/03-http-communication.md#http-status-codes) section for more information.
-   Response headers, like request headers, contain information about the request, such as the format of data sent, encoding information, or where to redirect the client.
-   A message body, typically used when the server sends data to the client.

>**âœ” Tip: Remember that HTTP is "stateless"**
>
>This means that there is no relationship made between two requests sent to the server, and the server doesn't assume any two requests are related. Each request must contain enough informationâ€”such as authenticationâ€”on its own for the server to fulfill the request.

## HTTP methods

HTTP methods are a pre-defined set of words that each indicate different actions that a client can perform for a given resource. These methods are typically called "HTTP verbs" since they often perform some action, though some are nouns. Methods only apply to requests, and every request must have a method.

| **Method** | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`      | The GET method requests data from the specified resource and must only be used by the client to retrieve data, not send it. This is the method that's used when you use a web browser to view a website. |
| `POST`     | The POST method submits data to the specified resource.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `PUT`      | The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload. You use this to "update" data, but it can "create" data if it doesn't exist.                        |
| `DELETE`   | The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.                                                                                                                                                        |

## HTTP status codes

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has completed successfully or not.

Status codes fall into different categories. For example, receiving a code in the 200-299 range means it's considered a success message. This helps because even if you don't know what that specific message is, you know what type of response it is.

There are five types of responses:

| **Code Range** | **Description**        |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| 100-199        | Information Responses  |
| 200-299        | Successful Responses   |
| 300-399        | Redirection Messages   |
| 400-499        | Client Error Responses |
| 500-599        | Server Error Responses |

The following table contains a list of common status codes and descriptions from each category:

| **Code**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100 Continue              | This interim response indicates that everything is okay so far and that the client may continue with the request or ignore it if it's already finished.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 200 OK                    | The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 201 Created               | The request has succeeded, and a new resource has been created as a result of it. This is typically the response sent after a POST request or after some PUT requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 202 Accepted              | The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It's non-committal, meaning that there's no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the request. It's intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.                                                                                                                                        |
| 204 No Content            | There's no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 301 Moved Permanently     | This and all future requests should be directed to a new URL that's returned in the response header.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 302 Found                 | This indicates that the resource at the requested URL has been changed temporarily. A change may still happen in the future, so unlike 301, future requests should still be made at the same URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 304 Not Modified          | Indicates the resource hasn't changed since last requested. Typically, the HTTP client provides a header like If-Modified-Since to provide a time against which to compare. Using this saves bandwidth and reprocessing on both the server and client, as only the header data must be sent and received, in comparison to the entirety of the page being reprocessed by the server, then sent again using more bandwidth of the server and client. |
| 400 Bad Request           | The request can't be fulfilled due to bad syntax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 401 Unauthorized          | For use when authentication is possible but has failed or not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 403 Forbidden             | The request was valid, but the server refuses to respond to it. Unlike a 401 Unauthorized response, the client may already be authenticated but doesn't have permission for the resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

# Web APIs

So far you've learned about URLs, how HTTP communication works, and how web pages are sent over the internet to your browser. These same technologies that allow you to surf the web also allow your program to communicate with other programs on the internet.

An **application programming interface** (API) is an interface that allows transfer of data between different computer programs. A **Web API** is an API that's accessible on the internet.

In today's information age, sharing information is vital. You might not realize it, but everything you use in your day-to-day life, like your phone, shares information with some other system.

These systems use Web APIs to share data. Some APIs are "public", which means that they're available for use by other developers. Others are "private", meaning that they're intended only for that product to use. You'll see examples of both in this section.

## APIs and banking applications

Most mobile banking applications provide the ability to check account balances, transfer funds, and even deposit checks. Here's what Fifth-Third Bank's mobile application looks like:

![Mobile Banking Application](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176066474-bb2f8cef-46c4-4d18-ad50-527014d9c78e.png)

Now, think about the data that lives inside of a banking application:

-   Balances of your account
    -   Checking
    -   Savings
    -   Business
    -   Credit Cards
-   Detailed list of transactions for each account
-   Statements (Reports)
-   Loan Information
    -   Mortgage
    -   Automobile
    -   Personal

Do you think all of this personal banking information is stored on your device? The answer is no. For one, storing that information on your device is a major security risk.

Secondly, you know that you can see this information if you visit your bank account's website on your computer. If this data was only available on your device, it'd have to be replicated on the web. Instead, the bank created an API that both the mobile and web applications use to retrieve the data.

## Amazon

You probably already know that Amazon sells millions of products. The Amazon application for your phone only takes about 20 seconds to install and is around 100 MB. So, Amazon can't have all the products they sell in the application.

A quick search for "vuejs" in the mobile application yields several results:

![Amazon Mobile App](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176066508-dcab2351-dcf1-419c-9ca4-1aa787ef505a.png)

When you install the Amazon application, you aren't downloading their entire product library. When you search for a product, get product details, or look at your account history, these are all Web API calls to Amazon. This allows the mobile application and their website to use the same service.

## ExchangeRate-API

So far you've seen private APIs, or those created by a company only intended for their product to use. But what about public APIs?

Say you're building an application that needs to provide exchange rates. There's a free public API for that called the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) . Given a three-letter currency code, such as `USD` for US Dollars or `EUR` for Euros, the service returns the current exchange rates to other currencies:

```json
{
  "base": "USD",
  "date": "2021-08-10",
  "time_last_updated": 1628553601,
  "rates": {
    "USD": 1,
    "AED": 3.67,
    "AFN": 79.94,
    "ALL": 103.28,
    "AMD": 491.29,
    "ANG": 1.79,
    "AOA": 643.02,
    "ARS": 96.89,
    "AUD": 1.36,
    "AWG": 1.79,
    //the rest omitted for brevity
  }
}
```

## Data exchange format - JSON

The data in the previous section is in a specific format called **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)**. JSON is a data-interchange format that's language independent and human-readable.

The structure is an `object`-like code block containing a set of `key : value` pairs. It appears to be an _object_, or _map_, or _dictionary_ depending upon the programming language you use. A list of values can also be represented using familiar array notation with `[ "value one", "value two", "etc" ]`. Note, square-brackets denote an array, and values don't have associated keys.

### JSON rules

The _key_, which is to the left of the `:` is double quoted. The _value_, which is to the right of `:`, is also double quoted, unless the _value_ is `null`, `true`, `false`, or a number. The value may include list values.

If you look at the `"rates"` key, you'll see the value is a code block. JSON structures can be as deeply nested as required.

This guide uses JSON as itâ€™s the most common format APIs use. Despite the name, JSON doesn't rely on or work only in JavaScript. It works in many programming languages.

# Testing APIs

Using the ExchangeRate-API, you can see the [results](https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD) from their API in your web browser. How's that possible?

This API methodâ€”often called an **API endpoint**â€”responds to a `GET` request, which is what your browser uses by default when you enter a URL, so their API returns the requested data.

Feel free to try their API with different currencies. Replace `USD` with `EUR` or `NZD`. You can find a list of their supported currencies at [Supported Currencies](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/supported-currencies) .

## Postman

Testing an API in a web browser doesn't work for API endpoints that require specific headers, need complex data parameters, or only respond to request methods other than `GET`.

However, there are better ways to test an API. One of the most widely used tools is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) . It's free to download and install on your computer.

The Intro to Tools: Postman unit can help you learn the Postman interface and how to create different types of requests.

### Using Postman to test ExchangeRate-API

Click the **Create a request** button under the "Get started" header on the right side of the window. You can also click the **+** button on the tab bar:

![Postman create request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176066635-82da5655-63d0-40a7-ac8e-7bd40427985b.png)

In the new tab that appears, enter `https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD` in the textbox that reads "Enter request URL":

![Postman request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176066666-2e676c0c-5535-4898-8366-530d0c605ead.png)

After you click the **Send** button, you'll see the response appear in the lower half of the window. It's the same JSON that you saw when you put that address in your web browser:

![Postman response](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176066690-9bf9722f-bb33-434a-99ac-a65905f66b8d.png)

Postman displays the status code along with the response. This response is `200 OK` which is a successful response:

![Postman response status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176066728-b71f66c6-3aff-4d52-bd4f-aa8ce2ee6b0a.png)

You can also view the response headers:

![Postman response headers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176066746-f5c728a3-ec24-42c2-93bf-74508271d27f.png)

Postman offers several great features such as changing the HTTP method, like `POST` and `PUT`, and setting parameters, headers, and body values for sending data. You'll see more about these features in a later unit.

# Quiz

## **Networking and HTTP 1**

**`.com`, `.net`, `.gov` are all examples of:**

â—‹ Port

â—‰ Top-level domain

â—‹ Fragment

â—‹ Protocol

**Explanation:** The top-level domain (TLD) is the last part of a domain in a URL.


## **Networking and HTTP 2**

**In the example URL below, what part is the query string?**

https://www.example.com/catalog?itemid=232&qty=5

â—‹ `/catalog`

â—‹ `https`

â—‹ `www`

â—‰ `itemid=232&qty=5`

**Explanation:** Query strings are key-value pairs separated by `&` that are sometimes used for dynamically generated pages. They immediately follow the `?`.


## **Networking and HTTP 3**

**What do you know about the following URL? (select all that apply)**

https://www.example.com:443/search?q=rugby

	Select all correct options

â–¡ The server it connects to is located in California.

â–  The request is encrypted from the browser to the server.

â–  The browser connects to that server on port 443.

â–  The browser sends information to the server, namely the value "rugby" with the key "q."

â–¡ The browser connects to the server at IP address 12.1.62.201.

**Explanation:** 
-   Since the URL has `https` as the protocol, the connection is encrypted from the browser to the server being connected to.
-   The port is defined as 443 in the URL. However, since the protocol is `https`, the browser defaults to connecting to port 443 anyway.
-   The query string after the `?` in the URL is how the browser sends information to the server, and it's a name/value pair of `q=rugby`.


## **Networking and HTTP 4**

**What's the service that allows computers to find IP addresses from URLs?**

â—‹ HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

â—‹ HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

â—‰ Domain Name System (DNS)

â—‹ Transport Layer Security (TLS)

**Explanation:** The Domain Name System (DNS) is the service that connects domains to IP addresses.


## **Networking and HTTP 5**

**`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` are examples of:**

â—‰ HTTP request methods

â—‹ Response status codes

â—‹ Network protocols

â—‹ HTTP headers

**Explanation:** HTTP request methods indicate the action that a client wants to perform.


## **Networking and HTTP 6**

**You received HTTP status code `403` from a Web API. You know that:**

â—‹ Any data sent was saved to the server.

â—‰ Some sort of error occurred.

â—‹ The request was successful.

â—‹ The server is redirecting to another URL.

**Explanation:** 4XX codes are client errors and specifically, `403` means "Forbidden."


## **Networking and HTTP 7**

**You got the following data from an API. What format is this?**

```json
{
    "color": "black",
    "category": "hue",
    "type": "primary",
    "code": {
        "rgba": [255,255,255,1],
        "hex": "#000"
    }
}
```

â—‹ XML

â—‹ SOAP

â—‰ JSON

â—‹ HTML

**Explanation:** This format is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
