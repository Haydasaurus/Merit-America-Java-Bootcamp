# What is REST?

You've learned how to build APIs, and more specifically, how to build Web Service APIs. These make your code and business logic available to other frontend and backend applications. While it may seem that the techniques you've learned are somewhat arbitrary, they all follow a common convention, like most web-based APIs. This convention is called "REST."

REST stands for **Representational State Transfer** and is a series of guidelines for defining Web Services that are flexible and usable by a wide range of services. Fundamentally, REST uses all the standard web technologies you've already learned: HTTP, URLs, and JSON. By building web services off of already widely adopted standards, REST allows you to tie APIs into existing applications.

REST APIs are based on the concept of "resources." Addresses (URLs) and actions (HTTP methods) both relate to those resources. A REST API uses HTTP status codes to inform clients about the results of calling the API.

# Resources

Most applications you create consist of resources. Resources are often the objects defined in the application.

For example, in a calendar application, the resources could be "days", "months", "years", "events", or "alarms." In an e-commerce site, the resources could be "products", "reviews", "categories", "carts", and "orders." These are the building blocks of the application and the pieces that hold the data and behavior that the application defines.

## Addressing resources

Once you've identified the resources, you can build URLs to them. Each resource normally has its own URL. You access, retrieve, and modify resources through URLs, depending on which HTTP method you use.

For example, if you wanted to work with your e-commerce site's products, you'd use the URL `https://www.omozan.com/products`. From there, you can look for a specific product, get all reviews for that product, or get a specific review for that product, as the table shows:

| **Goal**                                           | **URL**                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Access a single resource                           | `/products/342333`              |
| Access a resource that belongs to another resource | `/products/342333/reviews`      |
| Access a particular review for a given resource    | `/products/342333/reviews/5674` |

## Actions on resources

Actions on resources are defined by the HTTP methods of `GET` and `POST`, which you've already seen, and `PUT` and `DELETE`, which you may not have seen until now. These four methods are commonly used for "CRUD" operations on your resources.

### CRUD

CRUD is an acronym that stands for **Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete**. These are the four basic operations that you can perform on data:

-   To Create a new resource, you `POST` data to the URL for that resource.
-   To Retrieve resources, you `GET` from the URL for that resource. You can set this up to send search parameters to specify which products you want, like `GET /products?name=headphones` or `GET /products?addedAfter=2019-10-15`.
-   To Retrieve a specific resource, you `GET` from a resource URL with an ID.
-   To Update a resource, you `PUT` data to a resource URL with an ID.
-   To Delete a resource, you `DELETE` a resource URL with an ID.

The following table shows you how these CRUD operations apply to the `/products` example:

| **Operation** | **HTTP Method** | **URL**                     | **Use**                                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create        | `POST`          | `/products`                 | Create a new product using data passed in the request                       |
| Retrieve      | `GET`           | `/products`                 | Retrieve all products                                                       |
| Retrieve      | `GET`           | `/products?name=headphones` | Retrieve all products that match the search                                 |
| Retrieve      | `GET`           | `/products/5`               | Retrieve the product with an ID of 5                                        |
| Update        | `PUT`           | `/products/5`               | Update an existing product with an ID of 5 using data passed in the request |
| Delete        | `DELETE`        | `/products/5`               | Delete the product with an ID of 5                                          |

### Using POST versus PUT

The question of whether to use `POST` or `PUT` is frequently asked by developers new to REST. The answer lies in the term _idempotency_. Programmers say an operation is _idempotent_ if it produces the same result regardless of the number of times it's performed.

`PUT` is considered idempotent because no matter how many times you perform the `PUT` operation, the results remain the same. You've just updated the resource with the same values again.

`POST` on the other hand, isn't idempotent. Each time you `POST`, you create a new resource. If you `POST` a set of values five times, you've created five new resources.

So then, as the table says, use `POST` to create a resource and `PUT` to update it. Furthermore, the URL for a `POST` doesn't contain an ID since a new resource is created, while the URL for a `PUT` contains an ID to identify the resource to update.

### HTTP status codes

APIs return HTTP status codes, and these status codes inform frontend applications if any errors occurred or if everything worked successfully. Common codes that are returned are:

| HTTP status code | Description           | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200              | OK                    | Everything worked as expectedâ€”should have data returned. Common response to GET requests and to PUT requests when response includes data.                                                          |
| 201              | Created               | New resource was created. Common response to POST requests.                                                                                                                                        |
| 204              | No Content            | Everything worked but no data is returned. Common response to DELETE requests and to PUT requests when response doesn't include data.                                                              |
| 304              | Not Modified          | The data hasn't changed since it was last retrieved. Used to respond to GET requests so data doesn't have to be re-downloaded if it hasn't changed.                                                |
| 400              | Bad Request           | The request from the frontend had errors. Check the data passed back to see more specifics about the error. Often a data validation problem.                                                       |
| 401              | Unauthorized          | The user isn't allowed to perform this action either because they aren't logged in or because their login information is wrong.                                                                    |
| 403              | Forbidden             | The logged in user isn't allowed to perform this action because they don't have permission.                                                                                                        |
| 404              | Not Found             | The given URL doesn't point to a valid resource.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 405              | Method Not Allowed    | The HTTP method used isn't valid for this URL. This could be because certain resources can't be updated or deleted and don't support the PUT, DELETE, or POST methods.                             |
| 500              | Internal Server Error | The API itself has a problem and can't fulfill the request at this time. This could be due to a code issue or because services the API relies on, like databases or application servers, are down. |

These pieces work together to provide a foundation for designing a REST API.

# Creating REST APIs

In the previous unit, you learned how to create `GET` and `POST` handler methods. Creating `PUT` and `DELETE` handler methods follows a similar process and requires adding the respective HTTP method to the `RequestMapping` declaration:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/products/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
public Product update(@RequestBody Product product, @PathVariable int id) {
    product.setId(id);

    // Update product in underlying datastore

    return product;
}

@RequestMapping(path = "/products/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
public void delete(@PathVariable int id) {
    // Removes the product in underlying datastore
}
```

---

# Status codes

By default, if no errors are encountered, handler methods respond with a status code of 200, but there may be times when you want to return a different status code than the default one. For example, many REST APIs return a status code of 201 on a successful `POST` and a status code of 204 on a successful `DELETE`.

To control the status code of the response, you add the `@ResponseStatus` annotation. Here's a handler method for `DELETE` requests that responds with a status code of 204:

```java
@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT)
@RequestMapping(path = "/products/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
public void delete(@PathVariable int id) {

    // Remove the product from underlying datastore

}
```

There may also be times when you want to return a different status code than the default due to an error. For example, if a user wanted to update the product with an ID of `13` and that ID wasn't in the database, you'd want to return a 404 status code.

You can do that by setting up a special exception that's linked to that status code with a `@ResponseStatus` annotation:

```java
@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class ProductNotFoundException extends Exception {}
```

In your controller, if the request resource wasn't found, you throw a `new ProductNotFoundException()` and the `404 NOT FOUND` status code is returned to the front-end code for you. This lets you handle errors the way you normally would in Javaâ€”using exceptionsâ€”and those exceptions are then reported as HTTP status codes.

---

# Data validation

It's important that you handle data validation in your backend code _and_ your frontend code. To validate data in Java, you use a Java standard called **Bean Validations**.

Bean Validations are annotations that are added to Java model classes and verify that the data in objects match a certain set of criteria. For example, you might have a model class like the following:

```java
public class Product {
    private long id;
    private String sku;
    private String name;
    private BigDecimal price;
    private String description;

    /*** Getters and Setters ***/
}
```

If you wanted to make sure that all `Product`s had a name, a price greater than zero, a SKU that starts with "OMO-", and a description that had at least twenty characters in it, you could add all of those as validation annotations on the class like this:

```java
public class Product {

    private long id;

    @NotBlank(message="Product sku cannot be blank")
    @Pattern(regexp="^OMO-", message="Product sku must start with 'OMO-'")
    private String sku;

    @NotBlank(message="Product name cannot be blank")
    private String name;

    @Positive(message="Product price cannot be negative")
    private BigDecimal price;

    @Size(min=20, message="Description cannot be less than twenty characters")
    private String description;

    /*** Getters and Setters ***/
}
```

These annotations serve as a central place for validation information for this model. All validation annotations accept a message argument, which is the text displayed when the validation fails. Individual validation annotations may take additional arguments to further specify what's being validated.

Often used validations include:

| **Annotation** | **Applies to**        | **Description**                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @NotNull       | Any                   | The variable can't be null.                                                                                                  |
| @NotEmpty      | array, List, String   | The variable can't be null. Also, if it's a list or array, it can't be empty. If it's a String, it can't be an empty string. |
| @NotBlank      | String                | The variable can't be empty or only contain white space characters.                                                          |
| @Min           | int, long, BigDecimal | The variable must have a value greater than the specified minimum. Null values are skipped.                                  |
| @DecimalMin    | BigDecimal            | The variable must have a value greater than the specified minimum decimal. Null values are skipped.                          |
| @Size          | array, List, String   | The variable length, as an array, List, or String, must be within the bounds specified. Null values are skipped.             |
| @Past, @Future | Date, LocalDate       | The variable must represent a date in the past/future. Null values are skipped.                                              |
| @Pattern       | String                | The variable must hold a value that matches the specified regular expression. Null values are skipped.                       |

The validations that you add to your model objects aren't automatically checked for you. To check them in your controller, you need to add the `@Valid` annotation to the model:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.POST)
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
public void create(@Valid @RequestBody Product product) {
    // data validation
    productsDao.add(product);
}
```

If the validation fails, meaning that the data supplied from the request doesn't pass the validation tests you defined in the model, then the response returns a status code of 400, and the following JSON object is returned back:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-10-31T19:30:49.719+0000",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "errors": [
    {
      "codes": [
        "NotBlank.product.name",
        "NotBlank.name",
        "NotBlank.java.lang.String",
        "NotBlank"
      ],
      "arguments": [
        {
          "codes": [
            "product.name",
            "name"
          ],
          "arguments": null,
          "defaultMessage": "name",
          "code": "name"
        }
      ],
      "defaultMessage": "Product name cannot be blank",
      "objectName": "product",
      "field": "name",
      "rejectedValue": null,
      "bindingFailure": false,
      "code": "NotBlank"
    }
  ],
  "message": "Validation failed for object='product'. Error count: 1",
  "trace": "..."
}
```

You can then use this JSON object to give information back to the user about what went wrong by looping through `response.errors` and using the `field` and `defaultMessage` to get information about the error.

# Dependency injection

As applications become more complex, the number of classes and dependencies between classes increases. One of the objectives of Object-Oriented Programming is to make it easier to deal with complexity by making code modular.

You can _decompose_ functionality into different classes that each have a specific purpose and responsibility in the system. This way, instead of needing to understand an entire system all at once, you can think about one class at a time.

For example, controller classes commonly use DAOs to store and retrieve data. Up until now, you've created instances of DAOs in a controller like this:

```java
private HotelDao dao;

public HotelController() {
    dao = new MemoryHotelDao();
}
```

When a class uses, or depends on, another class, it's best to focus on _what_ the other class is doingâ€”that is, what service it's providingâ€”rather than _how_ it's doing it. While you can create a DAO in a controller this way, it ties the controller to a specific implementation, like an in-memory DAO implementation rather than a relational database. You should avoid doing this.

Then how can this class depend on another class without creating the object itself?

The technique for doing this is called **Dependency Injection**. Dependency Injection is where a framework (such as Spring) _injects_ instances of required classes into a new object rather than the object itself creating them. This further decouples the classes from each other and allows the controller to be completely independent from any implementation of the DAO interface.

## Configuring dependency injection

In Spring, if you want to inject one class into another, you add an annotation. For the DAOs, you add the `@Component` annotation:

```java
@Component
public class MemoryHotelDao implements HotelDao {
    ...
}
```

Now, the `MemoryHotelDao` class can be injected into other classes, like the controller. To inject the DAO into the controller, you declare a constructor parameter of the class you depend on in the controller like this:

```java
private HotelDao dao;

public HotelController(HotelDao dao) {
    this.dao = dao
}
```

When Spring creates the controller, it also creates an instance of the DAO class with the `@Component` annotation and injects it into the controller for you.

This also makes the controller easier to unit test. When creating a new controller in a unit test, you can pass in a test version of the `HotelDao`:

```java
HotelController testController = new HotelController(new TestHotelDao());
```

This allows the `HotelController` to depend on any `HotelDao` without tying it to a single implementation of `HotelDao`.

## Swapping implementations

Another reason to use dependency injection is if you ever need to change a componentâ€”for example, switching database platformsâ€”you can simplify your changes and testing.

If you design the system with dependency injection in mind, you can create a new DAO class that implements the same interface. Since your existing code uses the interface methods and not the class methods, the only code you'd need to change is the class that's provided by the injection.

## Conclusion

Dependency Injection is a powerful feature provided by many application frameworks, but it's an advanced topic that can be confusing at first, even for experienced programmers. For now, focus on the mechanics of injecting dependencies into classes. You'll see more examples of this later on and, over time, you'll become more comfortable with dependency injection.
