public Product update(@RequestBody Product product, @PathVariable int id) {
    // ...
}
```

○ `@RequestMapping(path = "/products", method = RequestMethod.PUT)`

◉ `@RequestMapping(path = "/products/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)`

○ `@RequestMapping(path = "/products/id", method = RequestMethod.PUT)`

○ `@RequestMapping(path = "/products/{product}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)`

**Explanation:** This is the correct mapping annotation, with a placeholder for `id` which matches the method parameter `id`.

    // ...
}
```
