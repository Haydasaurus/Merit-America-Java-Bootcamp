# Intro to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL (also known as Postgres) is a widely used, open source relational database management system (RDBMS). PostgreSQL has been around for more than 30 years and is used to store the data for popular websites like Reddit and Instagram.

## Why use PostgreSQL?

There are many options available for storing data. Some reasons a developer might choose PostgreSQL include:

-   Price - Unlike commercial options such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL is free.
-   SQL - PostgreSQL supports SQL, which is a powerful language for working with data. Other options like MongoDB don't support SQL.
-   Compatibility - Some options like Apache Derby or H2 are primarily intended for use with Java, but PostgreSQL can be used with virtually any programming language.
-   Scalability - PostgreSQL can be used for large amounts of data and many simultaneous users. Other options like SQLite are intended for a single user or smaller data sets.
-   Advanced features - While other options like MySQL focus on speed or ease-of-use, PostgreSQL offers a larger set of features for developers to use.

## Running PostgreSQL

When PostgreSQL is used in production by a business, it runs on a server located in a data center. When you're using PostgreSQL for learning and development, you'll run it locally on your computer, but it's still a server application that runs in the background. PostgreSQL doesn't have a visible user interface. This means that to use PostgreSQL, you'll need a client application like **pgAdmin**.# Intro to PostgreSQL

## Running PostgreSQL

When PostgreSQL is used in production by a business, it runs on a server located in a data center. When you're using PostgreSQL for learning and development, you'll run it locally on your computer, but it's still a server application that runs in the background. PostgreSQL doesn't have a visible user interface. This means that to use PostgreSQL, you'll need a client application like **pgAdmin**.

# pgAdmin

pgAdmin is a client application for PostgreSQL with a graphical user interface. You can use it to create new databases, import or export data, run SQL, display database diagrams, and many other tasks related to database administration and maintenance.

![pgAdmin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164761003-a3916bc2-d167-4420-abf2-5f7dd120c27d.png)

## Initial setup

The first time you run pgAdmin, it'll prompt you to set up a "master password." This can be anything as long as you can remember it. You can skip setting the password, but it'll prompt you every time you open pgAdmin.

On the left side of the window is the **Browser** pane. You might already see a server called "PostgreSQL 12" under the "Servers" list. If you don't see a server, add one by following these steps:

1.  Click on **Servers** and then select **Create > Server** from the **Object** menu.
2.  Type in any name in the **Name** field, like "PostgreSQL 12."
3.  On the **Connection** tab, type in "localhost" for the **Host name/address** field.
4.  Type in the password for the "postgres" user. This was provided to you separately. You may choose to save the password or not.
5.  Click the **Save** button.

## Connecting to PostgreSQL

Now that you have a server listed, connect to it by double-clicking on it or by clicking the caret on its side. If you didn't choose to save the password when setting up the connection, or you're using the default "PostgreSQL 12" connection, it'll prompt you for the password of the "postgres" user account. This was provided to you separately.

Once you've connected to the PostgreSQL server, you can proceed to set up the databases you'll use for tutorials and exercises.

# Database setup

There are three example databases that need to be set up in preparation for tutorials and exercises:

-   `PizzaShop` - contains data about a fictitious pizza shop's orders and customers
-   `UnitedStates` - contains data about US states, cities, and national parks
-   `MovieDB` - contains data about a sampling of movies and actors

Setting up each new database on your PostgreSQL server using pgAdmin consists of two steps:

1.  Create an empty database
2.  Run SQL to define structures and load data

## Create an empty database

To create a new, empty database with pgAdmin, click on your server (which, by default, is named "PostgreSQL 12") in the Browser pane. Then, on the **Object** menu, select **Create > Database**.

In the window that appears, enter a name in the **Database** field and click the **Save** button. For example, enter "PizzaShop" to create the `PizzaShop` database.

An entry for the new database is then added in the Browser pane beneath your server, in the **Databases** section.

### Create all three example databases

After creating the `PizzaShop` database, repeat the process for the `UnitedStates` and `MovieDB` databases, and confirm all three are listed beneath your server in the Browser pane.

## Run SQL to define structures and load data

To finish setting up a database, first select the database in the Browser pane. For example, select `PizzaShop`. Then, on the **Tools** menu, select **Query Tool**.

In the toolbar of the pane that appears on the right, click the **Open File** button:

![Open File button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164780453-640e0b35-c7e5-4e28-bd06-59b4ce54e688.png)

Navigate to the SQL file for the database. The `PizzaShop.sql` file is in your student repository under the `resources/postgresql` folder. Click the **Select** button, and the file opens in the Query Editor. Click the **Execute/Refresh** button:

![ExecuteRefresh button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164780576-f4838b04-ea19-457a-aa91-4b1fcc19deab.png)

Output then appears in the **Messages** pane near the bottom of the pgAdmin window, with a final line that begins, "Query returned successfully."

At this point, the database is set up and ready to use.

### Finish setting up all three example databases

After running the `PizzaShop.sql` file, repeat the process for the `UnitedStates` and `MovieDB` databases, with the corresponding SQL files in the `resources/postgresql` folder.

>**âœ” Tip: Re-run the starting SQL to reset the database**
>
>If you've modified a database and want to reset it back to its starting state, you can run the same SQL file that you used to initially set it up.

## Setting up other databases

Some exercises require you to set up additional databases. In those cases, you'll follow the same two steps, and you'll use the SQL file provided with the exercise.

# Generating database diagrams

To help visualize the structure of a database, you can generate basic database diagrams using pgAdmin.

To get started, select a database in the Browser pane. For example, select `PizzaShop`.

Next, on the **Object** menu, select **Generate ERD**, and an initial diagram is displayed.

You can then rearrange the elements of the diagram by clicking and dragging. Clicking and dragging on the background moves the entire diagram, and you can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel (or the **Zoom in** and **Zoom out** buttons on the toolbar).

After rearranging and adjusting the zoom, here's what a diagram of the `PizzaShop` database might look like:
