# Making requests

In the previous lesson, you learned how to make a `GET` request that showed you fake data that looked like a to-do list. However, the `GET` request method only retrieves data. There are other request methods that you can use to create, update, and delete data. In these next examples, you'll continue to use the same API to learn how to make these other requests with Postman.

## `GET` request

Before showing you how to make requests that change data, there's one more example to show you for retrieving data. The example in the previous lesson returned all to-dos stored on the server, but what if you wanted one particular record? You could use the same URL and pull out the one that you want, but that could be time-consuming to download all the records time over time, especially if the system had a large number of records.

Fortunately, most APIs offer another `GET` URL to retrieve one record. It's the same URL as before, but with a numerical ID at the end. For example, if you want to retrieve the to-do item with the ID of 1, you'd use `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`.

Create a new request, or use the same one if you still have it open, and set the request URL to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1` and click **Send**:

You'll see in the response that the API only sent back the to-do with the ID of 1. Try changing the ID and see how the response changes.

## `POST` request

A `POST` request is typically used to send data to a server, often with the intention of creating new data on the server for retrieval later. However, since this API is only used for testing, it doesn't save data, but it returns a response that would indicate that it was successful.

Create a new request with the URL `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`. The drop-down list to the left of the URL specifies the request method to use. By default, it's set to `GET`. Click the drop-down and select `POST`.

Next, under the URL bar are tabsâ€”such as Params, Authorization, and Headersâ€”that control various information about the request and the data sent. Data is often sent to a server, especially sensitive information like passwords, in the request body which you can access on the **Body** tab.

There are different request body formatsâ€”like `form-data` and `x-www-form-urlencoded`. Which format you use can depend on the API and the type of data. Many APIs send and receive a key-value format called **JSON**â€”short for JavaScript Object Notation. Despite the name, many programming languages besides JavaScript can generate and parse JSON. This guide and curriculum uses JSON for its APIs.

To send data in JSON format, select the **raw** radio button. After you select the radio button, a drop-down appears to the right of the last radio button, that allows you to select different "raw" formats, such as JSON:

![JSON format](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164790952-bf2fd697-5d80-4f9a-849e-0015a6755395.png)

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Is it necessary to select JSON?**
>
>Yes, because Postman sets a "header" that specifies the format of the data. If the server is expecting JSON but the header says the format is plain text, the server may not be able to process it even if it looks like valid JSON.
>
>An added bonus is that Postman has syntax highlighting for the raw formats, which helps you spot any format errors in your data.

Now you can enter some JSON to send to the server. In the field below the formats, enter the following text and click **Send**:

```json
{
    "userId": 1,
    "title": "Pet the dog",
    "completed": true
}
```

Your response looks like this:

![POST request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164791016-20168e3f-b4f1-4a12-bf12-b8e7c3173a28.png)

Notice how the response status is `201 Created`. Often an API returns this code if a `POST` was successful and created the record.

It's a coincidence that the ID in the response is also 201. The todos list has 200 items in it, so the next ID was 201.

## `PUT` request

A `PUT` request is similar to a `POST` request in that it's sending data to the server. The difference is that a `POST` request _creates_ data, and a `PUT` request _updates_ data.

Since this API doesn't save any data, you can't see the `PUT` request update data, but it still gives you a successful status.

Like when retrieving a single record, you'll need to provide the ID in the URL. In this example, you'll update the `completed` status for the to-do with the ID of 1.

Change the request method drop-down list item from `POST` to `PUT`, and set the URL to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`.

Use the following JSON as the request bodyâ€”make sure to include the curly braces:

```json
{
    "userId": 1,
    "title": "delectus aut autem",
    "completed": true
}
```

Then click the **Send** button and you'll see this response:

![PUT request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164791109-a3ebde71-4781-4bb8-9809-5e2b1e394c09.png)

Like with the `POST` request, the server returns back the updated data.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: PUT method return values**
>
>Some API `PUT` methods don't return the updated data, just a successful status code. It's up to the API developers if they include the updated record or not.

## `DELETE` request

The last request method to learn is `DELETE`. As you might guess by the name, it's intended to delete data.

Unlike `POST` and `PUT`, you don't have to send a request body to the server. Though like `PUT`, you provide the ID for the record to delete in the URL. Again, this API won't let you delete data, but it'll give you a successful status.

Change the request method to `DELETE` and set the Body value to **none**. Leave the URL as `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`. Click **Send** and you'll receive this response:

![DELETE request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164791157-856385d8-e5df-4f38-8085-5043b4a9a7f8.png)

Notice how the response is emptyâ€”as indicated by `{}`â€”because there's usually no data to return for a `DELETE`. However, the response status code tells you if it was successful.
