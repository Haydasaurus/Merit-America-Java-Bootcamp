# What's Postman?

Postman is a software tool that helps developers test Web APIs. An API, or **application programming interface**, is a way for different computer programs to transfer data between each other. A Web API is an API that's accessible over the internet.

If you've already read the unit on Web APIs, you'll know that they use URLs like websites, and that you can retrieve data from some APIs with a web browser. However, a browser isn't a good API testing tool because you can't do much more than simple `GET` requests, or requests that retrieve data. Interacting with an API often requires using different request methodsâ€”like `POST` and `PUT`â€”as well as sending data. Postman can do all of that and more.

Postman is an effective testing tool because it allows you to quickly create API requests, input request data, and read response data. If you're writing APIs, you can use Postman to test if your APIs are reacting correctly to requests. If you're writing software that interacts with an API, you can use Postman to analyze response data and troubleshoot your requests.

# Postman interface

Postman's interface can be a little overwhelming the first time you open it. This lesson helps you get acclimated to the interface and walks you through on how to create a request.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Account registration is optional**

>When running Postman for the first time, you'll see a screen prompting you to create a Postman account or sign in. An account allows you to back up your work and collaborate with others, but it's not required to use Postman. You can create an account at a later time if you wish. To skip creating an account for now, you can use the link at the bottom labelled **Skip and go to the app** to get started.

## Workspace view

Postman uses workspaces to group and organize related content. You can think of a workspace like a project you'd use in IntelliJ or Visual Studio.

If you're signed in, you can create multiple workspaces and share them with team members for collaboration. If you're not signed in, you get one workspace called the **Scratch Pad** that isn't synced or backed up online. This guide uses the Scratch Pad, but it's the same view you'd get in a workspace without access to some workspace-only components.

The sidebar on the left side of the window provides you access to the components that make up a workspace:

![Sidebar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164781888-23377f3d-d13e-4ca8-a285-b3eda7b5d8ab.png)

Until you start working on bigger projects, the two components you'll use most are the Collections and History components.

You can use Collections to save and group related requests together, making them easier to access and run. History shows you all the requests that you've run. Since you haven't made any requests yet, there's nothing to see, but you'll see how to save a request to a collection later.

You can minimize the left side of the window by going to the **View** menu and selecting **Toggle Sidebar**, or click the sidebar button in the lower left corner of the window:

![Sidebar button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164781937-ffae6bc7-eaca-4469-990f-5ca88cc1e6fe.png)

## Creating a request

Interacting with Web APIs involves requests and responses. The clientâ€”in this case, Postmanâ€”makes a **request** to a server which provides the **response**. The server in these examples is a free one that generates fake data for testing purposes.

First, click the **Create a request** button under the "Get started" header on the right side of the window. You can also click the **+** button on the tab bar:

![Create request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164781988-9b43798f-f318-4652-8da3-555796f3cbc0.png)

In the new tab that appears, enter `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos` in the textbox that reads "Enter request URL" and click the **Send** button. You'll see the response returned in the lower section of the window:

![Request and response](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164782037-d5e62f3e-a9b0-49ea-907c-708d33ee6e7f.png)

You just performed a `GET` request. The response from the server contains fake data that looks like a to-do list.

### Response status

When working with APIs, you'll have to work with response status codes that can tell you whether the response was a successful one or not. You can read more about status codes in the Networking and HTTP unit.

Postman displays the status code along with the response. This response is `200 OK` which is a successful response:

![Response status code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164782086-c0a6051a-0277-42ab-9fbe-c4d95f584bc5.png)

The time for the request to complete and the size of the response are displayed next to the status code. This information can help you diagnose slow requests in your application.

### Response headers

You can also view the response headers:

![Postman response headers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164782157-b061de24-165a-4862-aa5a-3b175d6bb126.png)

## Saving a request

Often you'll want to test an API more than once. Instead of changing the request URL and data every time, or keeping a lot of tabs open, you can save requests to come back to at a later time.

To save a request, click the **Save** button:

![Save request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164782209-e8b90116-10a7-4088-9f03-4c54f7b00fde.png)

In the window that appears, you can give the request a more meaningful name, like "GET all customers" or "POST new comment" depending on what your request is.

You can't save requests without being in collection, which is like a folder for related requests. Click the **Create a collection** button and give it a name like "Postman tests"â€”whatever seems like a good and meaningful name to you. After you type in the name, click the **Create** button. After you create or select a collection, you can click the **Save** button to save the request.

Once you save your request, you can see it in your Collections and reopen it at any time:

![Saved in collections](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164782262-88a5898f-bc77-4f98-a91b-848c43141a93.png)

## History

You can use the History component to review and rerun any request:

![History](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164782323-2efc826d-e6b3-475c-8951-6400dc8ed22e.png)

If you want to save a request from the history viewâ€”say you closed the tab by accident or decide later that you want to save itâ€”you can hover over any request and click the **+** sign to save it to a collection:

![Save from history](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164782366-78755707-c0c6-48a7-bd25-e3c079042042.png)

# Making requests

In the previous lesson, you learned how to make a `GET` request that showed you fake data that looked like a to-do list. However, the `GET` request method only retrieves data. There are other request methods that you can use to create, update, and delete data. In these next examples, you'll continue to use the same API to learn how to make these other requests with Postman.

## `GET` request

Before showing you how to make requests that change data, there's one more example to show you for retrieving data. The example in the previous lesson returned all to-dos stored on the server, but what if you wanted one particular record? You could use the same URL and pull out the one that you want, but that could be time-consuming to download all the records time over time, especially if the system had a large number of records.

Fortunately, most APIs offer another `GET` URL to retrieve one record. It's the same URL as before, but with a numerical ID at the end. For example, if you want to retrieve the to-do item with the ID of 1, you'd use `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`.

Create a new request, or use the same one if you still have it open, and set the request URL to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1` and click **Send**:

![GET request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164790917-bd889f3b-b000-4679-82f3-f4332fe2727b.png)

You'll see in the response that the API only sent back the to-do with the ID of 1. Try changing the ID and see how the response changes.

## `POST` request

A `POST` request is typically used to send data to a server, often with the intention of creating new data on the server for retrieval later. However, since this API is only used for testing, it doesn't save data, but it returns a response that would indicate that it was successful.

Create a new request with the URL `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`. The drop-down list to the left of the URL specifies the request method to use. By default, it's set to `GET`. Click the drop-down and select `POST`.

Next, under the URL bar are tabsâ€”such as Params, Authorization, and Headersâ€”that control various information about the request and the data sent. Data is often sent to a server, especially sensitive information like passwords, in the request body which you can access on the **Body** tab.

There are different request body formatsâ€”like `form-data` and `x-www-form-urlencoded`. Which format you use can depend on the API and the type of data. Many APIs send and receive a key-value format called **JSON**â€”short for JavaScript Object Notation. Despite the name, many programming languages besides JavaScript can generate and parse JSON. This guide and curriculum uses JSON for its APIs.

To send data in JSON format, select the **raw** radio button. After you select the radio button, a drop-down appears to the right of the last radio button, that allows you to select different "raw" formats, such as JSON:

![JSON format](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164790952-bf2fd697-5d80-4f9a-849e-0015a6755395.png)

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Is it necessary to select JSON?**
>
>Yes, because Postman sets a "header" that specifies the format of the data. If the server is expecting JSON but the header says the format is plain text, the server may not be able to process it even if it looks like valid JSON.
>
>An added bonus is that Postman has syntax highlighting for the raw formats, which helps you spot any format errors in your data.

Now you can enter some JSON to send to the server. In the field below the formats, enter the following text and click **Send**:

```json
{
    "userId": 1,
    "title": "Pet the dog",
    "completed": true
}
```

Your response looks like this:

![POST request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164791016-20168e3f-b4f1-4a12-bf12-b8e7c3173a28.png)

Notice how the response status is `201 Created`. Often an API returns this code if a `POST` was successful and created the record.

It's a coincidence that the ID in the response is also 201. The todos list has 200 items in it, so the next ID was 201.

## `PUT` request

A `PUT` request is similar to a `POST` request in that it's sending data to the server. The difference is that a `POST` request _creates_ data, and a `PUT` request _updates_ data.

Since this API doesn't save any data, you can't see the `PUT` request update data, but it still gives you a successful status.

Like when retrieving a single record, you'll need to provide the ID in the URL. In this example, you'll update the `completed` status for the to-do with the ID of 1.

Change the request method drop-down list item from `POST` to `PUT`, and set the URL to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`.

Use the following JSON as the request bodyâ€”make sure to include the curly braces:

```json
{
    "userId": 1,
    "title": "delectus aut autem",
    "completed": true
}
```

Then click the **Send** button and you'll see this response:

![PUT request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164791109-a3ebde71-4781-4bb8-9809-5e2b1e394c09.png)

Like with the `POST` request, the server returns back the updated data.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: PUT method return values**
>
>Some API `PUT` methods don't return the updated data, just a successful status code. It's up to the API developers if they include the updated record or not.

## `DELETE` request

The last request method to learn is `DELETE`. As you might guess by the name, it's intended to delete data.

Unlike `POST` and `PUT`, you don't have to send a request body to the server. Though like `PUT`, you provide the ID for the record to delete in the URL. Again, this API won't let you delete data, but it'll give you a successful status.

Change the request method to `DELETE` and set the Body value to **none**. Leave the URL as `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`. Click **Send** and you'll receive this response:

![DELETE request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/164791157-856385d8-e5df-4f38-8085-5043b4a9a7f8.png)

Notice how the response is emptyâ€”as indicated by `{}`â€”because there's usually no data to return for a `DELETE`. However, the response status code tells you if it was successful.
