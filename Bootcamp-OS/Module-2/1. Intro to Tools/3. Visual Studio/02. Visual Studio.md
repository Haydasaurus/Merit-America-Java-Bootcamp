# Visual Studio

Visual Studio is the most popular IDE among C# programmers. It was originally released in 1997, before the .NET platform was even released. It's available in a free **_Community_** edition and in subscription-based paid editions. Microsoft also offers **_Visual Studio for Mac_**.

Using Visual Studio, developers can write code in a great number of languages, including:

-   C#
-   Web languages like ASP.NET, HTML, and CSS
-   Structured Query Language (SQL)
-   JavaScript and TypeScript
-   Visual Basic
-   F#
-   Python
-   C++

Visual Studio includes built-in support for Git, the most popular versioning system, and others.

Visual Studio includes the idea of solutions and projects. You typically create or open a **solution** to do your work. A solution is just a container of one or more **projects**. Each project is a folder structure containing code that compiles into an executable program or website. For example, you may have a **_solution_** which contains one **_project_** which compiles into a runnable program, and another **_project_** which compiles into a test library that verifies the first project runs correctly.
