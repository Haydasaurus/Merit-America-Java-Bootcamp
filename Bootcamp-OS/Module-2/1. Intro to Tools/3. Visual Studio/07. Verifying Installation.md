# Verifying installation

To confirm you have Visual Studio properly installed on your computer, and also practice opening, running, and testing a project, perform the following steps.

## Step 1: Open the HelloWorld project

1.  Launch Visual Studio. Under **_Get Started_**, select **Open a project or solution**.

2.  Navigate to the `HelloWorld` project folder located in your student repository, under `resources/visual-studio/HelloWorld`. Click on the file `HelloWorld.sln` and click the **Open** button.

Once opened, the Solution Explorer window shows a solution called `HelloWorld`, which contains two projects, `HelloWorld` and `HelloWorldTests`.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: If you don't see Solution Explorer**
>
>If you don't see the Solution Explorer window or accidentally close it while working, from the menu bar select **View > Solution Explorer**.

## Step 2: Run the HelloWorld project

1.  Select **Debug > Start Debugging** from the menu to compile and start the program.
2.  Alternatively, you can press the **F5** key, or click on the green "play" arrow on the toolbar.

Running the project launches a console window that displays text similar to this:

```
Hello World!
Today is Tuesday, November 16, 2021
The current time is 1:54 PM
```

The date and current time reflects the date and current time you run the project.

Press **Enter** to dismiss the console window after the program finishes running.

## Step 3: Test the HelloWorld project

1.  From the menu bar, select **Test > Run All Tests**.
2.  Visual Studio opens Test Explorer, lists the tests, runs the tests, and displays the results.

Green checkmarks represent a passing test, and red x's mean the test failed. Note that Test Explorer displays tests in collapsible sections, so you may need to "expand" sections by clicking on the triangle to see all tests:

If you have any trouble with opening, running, or testing, please review with your instructor.
