# Creating a new C# project

Launch Visual Studio. From the screen that appears, under **_Get Started_**, select **Create a new project**.

>If a previous solution opens rather than the Welcome screen, go to the main menu and select **File > Close Solution**.

The next screen lists templates from which you can create a project. You'll create what's known as a console application. In the **Search for templates** box at the top of the screen, type "Console."

The list filters to only console projects. You want to create a console application on **_.NET Core_**, in the language **_C#_**. Look for a project template that has both of those elements:

Select this project template and click **Next**.

Give your project and solution a name and folder location, or accept the defaults. Press **Create**. Visual Studio creates a solution which contains a single project, your new console application.
