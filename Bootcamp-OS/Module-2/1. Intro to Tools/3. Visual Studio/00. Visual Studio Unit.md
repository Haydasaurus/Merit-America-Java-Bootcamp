# Integrated development environment (IDE)

If you were a programmer in the early days of computing, you wrote applications on punch cards. One line of code, one punch card. You stacked the cards horizontally in cardboard trays, taking great care to keep the cards unbent and in order.

When the application was ready, you carried the tray to the jobs desk and scheduled the application to run. The turnaround time between submitting a job and getting results could be anywhere from minutes to days, depending upon the availability of the computer and the priority of the application. It was a slow and tedious process.

Thankfully, programming has changed since then. Over time, programmers have been able to leverage improvements in hardware and software to make their work easier and more manageable. Vendors developed text editors so programmers could write the code on screens and not on punch cards. Early languages like Basic and Pascal even had specific programming environments with built-in capabilities tailored for each language.

Additionally, as programming transformed from programmers working alone and into broader team efforts, a new breed of tools to share and communicate emerged. Eventually, all these things came together into a single tool called an **integrated development environment** (IDE).

In general, IDEs share several common features.

## Projects

All of the resources of an application, including its source code, tests, libraries, and other types of files like sounds and images exist in a folder structure on the local hard drive known as the project folder, or **project** for short.

There's other information related to a project that's tracked by the IDE, such as the language version, build settings, and links to external resources. The IDE maintains this information in the **project settings**.

The IDE displays resources in a tree structure with the project as the root of the tree. You navigate between the various resources the same way you do in the Windows File Explorer. When you click on a specific resource, the IDE displays the contents of the resource in an editor or viewer depending upon its type.

The IDE gives the programmer the ability to copy, move, add, change, and remove resources. A version control system, if present, tracks all these changes, and allows the programmer to undo them if needed.

## Language-specific enhancements

Perhaps one of the most appreciated features of an IDE is the assistance when working with source code.

### Syntax highlighting

**Syntax highlighting** displays text in different colors and fonts to help programmers quickly identify and understand the various parts of code. In addition to making code more readable, syntax highlighting is often used to point out the location of errors. Some examples include a misspelled keyword or a mismatched pair like an opening parenthesis without a closing parenthesis.

### Intelligent code completion

Intelligent code completion, often called **IntelliSense**, is a language-aware code completion feature. It provides suggested bits of code that the programmer can either ignore or accept as they type. IntelliSense can help to increase programmer productivity while significantly reducing typos and other common mistakes.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: IntelliSense**
>
>Technically, "IntelliSense" is Microsoft's version of intelligent code completion included in Visual Studio and other Microsoft products.

In addition to these features, many IDEs offer a number of extras such as debugging tools to track down and fix problems, refactoring tools to improve code quality, connection management to services such databases, and profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.

# Visual Studio

Visual Studio is the most popular IDE among C# programmers. It was originally released in 1997, before the .NET platform was even released. It's available in a free **_Community_** edition and in subscription-based paid editions. Microsoft also offers **_Visual Studio for Mac_**.

Using Visual Studio, developers can write code in a great number of languages, including:

-   C#
-   Web languages like ASP.NET, HTML, and CSS
-   Structured Query Language (SQL)
-   JavaScript and TypeScript
-   Visual Basic
-   F#
-   Python
-   C++

Visual Studio includes built-in support for Git, the most popular versioning system, and others.

Visual Studio includes the idea of solutions and projects. You typically create or open a **solution** to do your work. A solution is just a container of one or more **projects**. Each project is a folder structure containing code that compiles into an executable program or website. For example, you may have a **_solution_** which contains one **_project_** which compiles into a runnable program, and another **_project_** which compiles into a test library that verifies the first project runs correctly.

# Creating a new C# project

Launch Visual Studio. From the screen that appears, under **_Get Started_**, select **Create a new project**.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: What if the welcome screen doesn't appear?**
>
>If a previous solution opens rather than the Welcome screen, go to the main menu and select **File > Close Solution**.

The next screen lists templates from which you can create a project. You'll create what's known as a console application. In the **Search for templates** box at the top of the screen, type "Console."

The list filters to only console projects. You want to create a console application on **_.NET Core_**, in the language **_C#_**. Look for a project template that has both of those elements:

![Select project template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176057110-a34aa597-a862-49d5-9bd1-a375aa053577.png)

Select this project template and click **Next**.

Give your project and solution a name and folder location, or accept the defaults. Press **Create**. Visual Studio creates a solution which contains a single project, your new console application.

# Opening an existing project

There are two common ways to open an existing solution in Visual Studio:

-   From Windows Explorer
-   From Visual Studio

## Open a solution from Windows Explorer

If Visual Studio isn't running, use Windows Explorer to navigate to the folder that holds the solution file. Visual Studio solution files end in the extension `.sln`.

Double-click on the solution file, and Windows launches Visual Studio, and loads the solution.

## Open a solution from Visual Studio

If Visual Studio is already running, Use the menu bar to select **File > Open > Project/Solution...**. Use the file dialog to navigate to the folder location, click on the solution (`.sln`) file, and click the **Open** button.

---

# Running a C# application

Now that you've created your project in Visual Studio, you can run your application in any of these ways:

-   From the menu bar, select **Debug > Start Debugging**.
-   From the toolbar, click the green "play" arrow next to the name of the application.
-   On your keyboard, press the **F5** key.

---

# Running tests

If there is a test project included in the solution, you can run all the tests in that project.

From the menu bar, select **Test > Run All Tests**. Visual Studio opens a window called **_Test Explorer_**, and then runs all the tests. You can start subsequent test runs by clicking the green arrow in the Test Explorer toolbar.

---

# Verifying installation

To confirm you have Visual Studio properly installed on your computer, and also practice opening, running, and testing a project, perform the following steps.

## Step 1: Open the HelloWorld project
	
1.  Launch Visual Studio. Under **_Get Started_**, select **Open a project or solution**.

2.  Navigate to the `HelloWorld` project folder located in your student repository, under `resources/visual-studio/HelloWorld`. Click on the file `HelloWorld.sln` and click the **Open** button.

Once opened, the Solution Explorer window shows a solution called `HelloWorld`, which contains two projects, `HelloWorld` and `HelloWorldTests`.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: If you don't see Solution Explorer**
>
>If you don't see the Solution Explorer window or accidentally close it while working, from the menu bar select **View > Solution Explorer**.

## Step 2: Run the HelloWorld project

1.  Select **Debug > Start Debugging** from the menu to compile and start the program.
2.  Alternatively, you can press the **F5** key, or click on the green "play" arrow on the toolbar.

Running the project launches a console window that displays text similar to this:

```
Hello World!
Today is Tuesday, November 16, 2021
The current time is 1:54 PM
```

The date and current time reflects the date and current time you run the project.

Press **Enter** to dismiss the console window after the program finishes running.

## Step 3: Test the HelloWorld project

1.  From the menu bar, select **Test > Run All Tests**.
2.  Visual Studio opens Test Explorer, lists the tests, runs the tests, and displays the results.

Green checkmarks represent a passing test, and red x's mean the test failed. Note that Test Explorer displays tests in collapsible sections, so you may need to "expand" sections by clicking on the triangle to see all tests:

![Test Explorer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176057512-22946d4d-a563-435d-b782-fdc61f00631a.png)


If you have any trouble with opening, running, or testing, please review with your instructor.
