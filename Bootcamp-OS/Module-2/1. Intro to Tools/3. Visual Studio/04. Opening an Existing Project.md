# Opening an existing project

There are two common ways to open an existing solution in Visual Studio:

-   From Windows Explorer
-   From Visual Studio

## Open a solution from Windows Explorer

If Visual Studio isn't running, use Windows Explorer to navigate to the folder that holds the solution file. Visual Studio solution files end in the extension `.sln`.

Double-click on the solution file, and Windows launches Visual Studio, and loads the solution.

## Open a solution from Visual Studio

If Visual Studio is already running, Use the menu bar to select **File > Open > Project/Solution...**. Use the file dialog to navigate to the folder location, click on the solution (`.sln`) file, and click the **Open** button.
