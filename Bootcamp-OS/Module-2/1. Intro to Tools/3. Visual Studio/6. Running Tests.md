# Running tests

If there is a test project included in the solution, you can run all the tests in that project.

From the menu bar, select **Test > Run All Tests**. Visual Studio opens a window called **_Test Explorer_**, and then runs all the tests. You can start subsequent test runs by clicking the green arrow in the Test Explorer toolbar.
