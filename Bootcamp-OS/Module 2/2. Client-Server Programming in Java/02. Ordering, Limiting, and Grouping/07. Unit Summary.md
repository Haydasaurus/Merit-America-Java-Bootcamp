# Unit summary

In this unit, you learned how to:

-   Order results in SQL
-   Limit the number of rows returned
-   Group similar rows and use aggregate functions
-   Use the string concatenation operator

>ðŸ›ˆ Note: Clause order
>
>In imperative programming, like Java, your statements always run from top to bottom and left to right. However, SQL is a declarative language and does **_not_** run from top to bottom and left to right. So what order does it run in?
>
>`SELECT` statement clauses are always runâ€”and can be thought throughâ€”in the following order:
>
>-   `FROM` clause - You use a `FROM` clause to indicate which table to select the data from.
>-   `WHERE` clause - You use a `WHERE` clause to narrow down the number of rows you'll work with.
>-   `GROUP BY` clause - You use a `GROUP` BY clause to group multiple rows that have a common value.
>-   `SELECT` clause - You use the `SELECT` clause to identify which columns you want data from.
>-   `ORDER BY` clause - You use an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the rows before they're returned.
>-   `LIMIT` clause - You use a `LIMIT` clause to reduce the number of rows.
