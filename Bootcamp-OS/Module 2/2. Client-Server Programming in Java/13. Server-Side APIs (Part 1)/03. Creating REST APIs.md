# Creating REST APIs

In the previous unit, you learned how to create `GET` and `POST` handler methods. Creating `PUT` and `DELETE` handler methods follows a similar process and requires adding the respective HTTP method to the `RequestMapping` declaration:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/products/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
public Product update(@RequestBody Product product, @PathVariable int id) {
    product.setId(id);

    // Update product in underlying datastore

    return product;
}

@RequestMapping(path = "/products/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
public void delete(@PathVariable int id) {
    // Removes the product in underlying datastore
}
```
