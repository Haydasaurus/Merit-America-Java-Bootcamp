# Resources

Most applications you create consist of resources. Resources are often the objects defined in the application.

For example, in a calendar application, the resources could be "days", "months", "years", "events", or "alarms." In an e-commerce site, the resources could be "products", "reviews", "categories", "carts", and "orders." These are the building blocks of the application and the pieces that hold the data and behavior that the application defines.

## Addressing resources

Once you've identified the resources, you can build URLs to them. Each resource normally has its own URL. You access, retrieve, and modify resources through URLs, depending on which HTTP method you use.

For example, if you wanted to work with your e-commerce site's products, you'd use the URL `https://www.omozan.com/products`. From there, you can look for a specific product, get all reviews for that product, or get a specific review for that product, as the table shows:

| **Goal**                                           | **URL**                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Access a single resource                           | `/products/342333`              |
| Access a resource that belongs to another resource | `/products/342333/reviews`      |
| Access a particular review for a given resource    | `/products/342333/reviews/5674` |

## Actions on resources

Actions on resources are defined by the HTTP methods of `GET` and `POST`, which you've already seen, and `PUT` and `DELETE`, which you may not have seen until now. These four methods are commonly used for "CRUD" operations on your resources.

### CRUD

CRUD is an acronym that stands for **Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete**. These are the four basic operations that you can perform on data:

-   To Create a new resource, you `POST` data to the URL for that resource.
-   To Retrieve resources, you `GET` from the URL for that resource. You can set this up to send search parameters to specify which products you want, like `GET /products?name=headphones` or `GET /products?addedAfter=2019-10-15`.
-   To Retrieve a specific resource, you `GET` from a resource URL with an ID.
-   To Update a resource, you `PUT` data to a resource URL with an ID.
-   To Delete a resource, you `DELETE` a resource URL with an ID.

The following table shows you how these CRUD operations apply to the `/products` example:

| **Operation** | **HTTP Method** | **URL**                     | **Use**                                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create        | `POST`          | `/products`                 | Create a new product using data passed in the request                       |
| Retrieve      | `GET`           | `/products`                 | Retrieve all products                                                       |
| Retrieve      | `GET`           | `/products?name=headphones` | Retrieve all products that match the search                                 |
| Retrieve      | `GET`           | `/products/5`               | Retrieve the product with an ID of 5                                        |
| Update        | `PUT`           | `/products/5`               | Update an existing product with an ID of 5 using data passed in the request |
| Delete        | `DELETE`        | `/products/5`               | Delete the product with an ID of 5                                          |

### Using POST versus PUT

The question of whether to use `POST` or `PUT` is frequently asked by developers new to REST. The answer lies in the term _idempotency_. Programmers say an operation is _idempotent_ if it produces the same result regardless of the number of times it's performed.

`PUT` is considered idempotent because no matter how many times you perform the `PUT` operation, the results remain the same. You've just updated the resource with the same values again.

`POST` on the other hand, isn't idempotent. Each time you `POST`, you create a new resource. If you `POST` a set of values five times, you've created five new resources.

So then, as the table says, use `POST` to create a resource and `PUT` to update it. Furthermore, the URL for a `POST` doesn't contain an ID since a new resource is created, while the URL for a `PUT` contains an ID to identify the resource to update.

### HTTP status codes

APIs return HTTP status codes, and these status codes inform frontend applications if any errors occurred or if everything worked successfully. Common codes that are returned are:

| HTTP status code | Description           | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200              | OK                    | Everything worked as expectedâ€”should have data returned. Common response to GET requests and to PUT requests when response includes data.                                                          |
| 201              | Created               | New resource was created. Common response to POST requests.                                                                                                                                        |
| 204              | No Content            | Everything worked but no data is returned. Common response to DELETE requests and to PUT requests when response doesn't include data.                                                              |
| 304              | Not Modified          | The data hasn't changed since it was last retrieved. Used to respond to GET requests so data doesn't have to be re-downloaded if it hasn't changed.                                                |
| 400              | Bad Request           | The request from the frontend had errors. Check the data passed back to see more specifics about the error. Often a data validation problem.                                                       |
| 401              | Unauthorized          | The user isn't allowed to perform this action either because they aren't logged in or because their login information is wrong.                                                                    |
| 403              | Forbidden             | The logged in user isn't allowed to perform this action because they don't have permission.                                                                                                        |
| 404              | Not Found             | The given URL doesn't point to a valid resource.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 405              | Method Not Allowed    | The HTTP method used isn't valid for this URL. This could be because certain resources can't be updated or deleted and don't support the PUT, DELETE, or POST methods.                             |
| 500              | Internal Server Error | The API itself has a problem and can't fulfill the request at this time. This could be due to a code issue or because services the API relies on, like databases or application servers, are down. |

These pieces work together to provide a foundation for designing a REST API.
