# Data validation

It's important that you handle data validation in your backend code _and_ your frontend code. To validate data in Java, you use a Java standard called **Bean Validations**.

Bean Validations are annotations that are added to Java model classes and verify that the data in objects match a certain set of criteria. For example, you might have a model class like the following:

```java
public class Product {
    private long id;
    private String sku;
    private String name;
    private BigDecimal price;
    private String description;

    /*** Getters and Setters ***/
}
```

If you wanted to make sure that all `Product`s had a name, a price greater than zero, a SKU that starts with "OMO-", and a description that had at least twenty characters in it, you could add all of those as validation annotations on the class like this:

```java
public class Product {

    private long id;

    @NotBlank(message="Product sku cannot be blank")
    @Pattern(regexp="^OMO-", message="Product sku must start with 'OMO-'")
    private String sku;

    @NotBlank(message="Product name cannot be blank")
    private String name;

    @Positive(message="Product price cannot be negative")
    private BigDecimal price;

    @Size(min=20, message="Description cannot be less than twenty characters")
    private String description;

    /*** Getters and Setters ***/
}
```

These annotations serve as a central place for validation information for this model. All validation annotations accept a message argument, which is the text displayed when the validation fails. Individual validation annotations may take additional arguments to further specify what's being validated.

Often used validations include:

| **Annotation** | **Applies to**        | **Description**                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @NotNull       | Any                   | The variable can't be null.                                                                                                  |
| @NotEmpty      | array, List, String   | The variable can't be null. Also, if it's a list or array, it can't be empty. If it's a String, it can't be an empty string. |
| @NotBlank      | String                | The variable can't be empty or only contain white space characters.                                                          |
| @Min           | int, long, BigDecimal | The variable must have a value greater than the specified minimum. Null values are skipped.                                  |
| @DecimalMin    | BigDecimal            | The variable must have a value greater than the specified minimum decimal. Null values are skipped.                          |
| @Size          | array, List, String   | The variable length, as an array, List, or String, must be within the bounds specified. Null values are skipped.             |
| @Past, @Future | Date, LocalDate       | The variable must represent a date in the past/future. Null values are skipped.                                              |
| @Pattern       | String                | The variable must hold a value that matches the specified regular expression. Null values are skipped.                       |

The validations that you add to your model objects aren't automatically checked for you. To check them in your controller, you need to add the `@Valid` annotation to the model:

```java
@RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.POST)
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
public void create(@Valid @RequestBody Product product) {
    // data validation
    productsDao.add(product);
}
```

If the validation fails, meaning that the data supplied from the request doesn't pass the validation tests you defined in the model, then the response returns a status code of 400, and the following JSON object is returned back:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-10-31T19:30:49.719+0000",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "errors": [
    {
      "codes": [
        "NotBlank.product.name",
        "NotBlank.name",
        "NotBlank.java.lang.String",
        "NotBlank"
      ],
      "arguments": [
        {
          "codes": [
            "product.name",
            "name"
          ],
          "arguments": null,
          "defaultMessage": "name",
          "code": "name"
        }
      ],
      "defaultMessage": "Product name cannot be blank",
      "objectName": "product",
      "field": "name",
      "rejectedValue": null,
      "bindingFailure": false,
      "code": "NotBlank"
    }
  ],
  "message": "Validation failed for object='product'. Error count: 1",
  "trace": "..."
}
```

You can then use this JSON object to give information back to the user about what went wrong by looping through `response.errors` and using the `field` and `defaultMessage` to get information about the error.
