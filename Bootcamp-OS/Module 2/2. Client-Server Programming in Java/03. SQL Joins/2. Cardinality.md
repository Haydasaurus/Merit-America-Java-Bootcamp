# Cardinality

You know that cities and countries are related in real life. You also know that countries contain many cities, and a city is inside one country. There are a few different kinds of relationships that you'll want to model in your database. Here, you'll look at the most common two: one-to-many and many-to-many.

## One-to-Many

In the earlier example, the relationship between a city and a country is a **one-to-many** relationship. It can be expressed as, "A city is in only one country, and a country has many cities."

To model this in your SQL tables, you'd have a primary key on both tables and a foreign key on the table that has the _many_ part of the relationship—the city in this example.

Primary keys must be unique, but foreign keys don't have to be. Having a `country_id` on city means that many cities can have the same country. If you put a `city_id` on the `country` table, then a country could only have one city per row, which isn't what you want. So, because it's one country having many cities, you put the foreign key to country on the `city` table.

## Many-to-Many

But sometimes you want both sides of the relationship to be many. For example, if you want to model films and actors, you'd have a many-to-many relationship. You'd say, "An actor can be in many films, and a film can have many actors."

The question now is where the foreign key goes. If you put it on the `film` table, then a film could only have one actor. If you put it on the `actor` table, then an actor could only be in one film. Neither of those scenarios is what you want.

If you don't want the foreign key on the `film` table and you don't want it on the `actor` table, you must put it in its own table.

That `actor_film` table is a **join table** or an associative table. It's a required technique to join two tables together in a many-to-many relationship.

In the example, you still have primary keys on the `actor` and `film` tables, but then you put the foreign keys onto a new table called `actor_film`. So the `actor_film` table can have many rows with the same actor and many rows with the same film. This satisfies the need to link the `actor` and `film` tables together in a many-to-many relationship.

### Database naming conventions

You might wonder how to come up with these names for your tables and their rows. It's not random, but it's also not something set in stone either. Wherever you end up, the company most likely has a naming convention that they already follow.

The convention this book uses has the following features:

-   Tables usually relate to some object that you have in your application, like a city and a country. Table names are singular (city instead of cities), and "snake-cased"—meaning all lowercase letters, with words separated by underscore (as in `actor_film`).
-   Primary keys are usually integers and are usually named as `(tablename)_id`, as in `city_id` as the primary key for the `city` table.
-   Foreign keys usually have the same name as their matching primary key, which inherently states which table it comes from.
-   Join tables are the two table names concatenated together with a `_` in the middle, with the names arranged alphabetically, like `actor_film` and not `film_actor`.

Again, these aren't requirements, and you could see databases set up much differently than this. It's better to understand the concepts than to memorize the naming.
