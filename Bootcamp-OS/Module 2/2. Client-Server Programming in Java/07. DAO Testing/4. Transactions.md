# Transactions

It's important that DAO tests are independent of each other. This means, for example, that one test calling a DAO method that deletes records in the temporary database won't change how many records DAO methods called in other tests can access. To achieve this independence, you restore the temporary database to its original state after each test. That way, in every test, the DAO has the same data to work with.

To restore the database after each test, you use a **transaction**. Starting a transaction before a test runs and rolling back the transaction after it's completed ensures the changes a test makes to the database only last for the duration of that individual test.

## `setAutoCommit()` and `rollback()`

By default when you run SQL using Spring's `JdbcTemplate`, the `DataSource` commits your changes automatically. You can change that behavior using the `setAutoCommit()` method of the `DataSource`:

```java
dataSource.setAutoCommit(false);
```

With auto commit turned off, you can discard any changes you make to the database by calling the `rollback()` method of the `Connection` property of the `DataSource` like this:

```java
dataSource.getConnection().rollback();
```

When writing DAO tests, you typically do that in a method of the test class with the `@After` annotation so it happens after each test:

```java
@After
public void rollback() throws SQLException {
    mockDataSource.getConnection().rollback();
}
```
