# Classes and encapsulation

You started working with primitive data types, and they can be disappointingly simplistic. Arrays add some new capability, but they're fixed in size. Fortunately, the collections framework offers the opportunity to work with more complex objects created from class definitions.

Still, what if you want to create your own data type, like the time on a clock?

```java
int hour = 11;
int minute = 23;
int second = 42;
```

This works, but if you want your program to store multiple clocks, you may run into trouble:

```java
int[] hours = new int[] { 11, 8 };
int[] minutes = new int[] { 23, 17 };
int[] seconds = new int[] { 42, 58 };
```

This is a problem, as you need to ensure that all of the values remain in sync, and that you don't inadvertently update `hours[0]` and `minutes[1]`.

Now, you'll learn how to create your own data type that has properties, such as hour and minute. Like a real clock, your data type also ticks, counting second by second.

To do this, you'll create something called a class.
