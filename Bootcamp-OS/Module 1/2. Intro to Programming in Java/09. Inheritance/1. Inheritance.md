# Inheritance

Another OOP principle is **Inheritance**, which is the act of having one class adopt the properties and methods of another class. This prevents code duplication and allows you to share code across classes while having the source code live in only one class file.

## Class hierarchies

Using inheritance to organize your classes allows you to build a class hierarchy of your code. You could think of inheritance as a parent-child relationship.

In the example, there is a variety of different types of clocks that you must define in your code. They're arranged here in a hierarchy.

Both `GrandfatherClock` and `CuckooClock` are types of clocks. The `Clock` class defines all the characteristics of what a clock is, such as holding the hours, minutes, seconds, and advancing the time. `GrandfatherClock` and `CuckooClock` adopt these characteristics. They then add their own characteristics, like the pendulum of the `GrandfatherClock` or the little bird that comes out of the `CuckooClock`. They may look different, but they're still fundamentally clocks.

In fact, programmers would say that if a `GrandfatherClock` inherits from `Clock`, then a `GrandfatherClock` object _IS A_ `Clock`. `GrandfatherClock` is the **subclass** and `Clock` is the **superclass**. This is the same for `CuckooClock`. `CuckooClock` is the **subclass** and `Clock` is the **superclass**.

Another thing to notice is that `AlarmClock` is a **subclass** of `Clock`, but it's also a **superclass** of `DigitalAlarmClock`. This means that `DigitalAlarmClock` IS A `AlarmClock` and IS A `Clock`. It inherits the properties and methods from all of the classes above it in the hierarchy.
