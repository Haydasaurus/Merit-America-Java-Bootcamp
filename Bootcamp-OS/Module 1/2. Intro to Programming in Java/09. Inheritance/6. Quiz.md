**Inheritance 1**

The inheritance relationship can be described by filling in the blank with which phrase?

**Square _____________ Rectangle**

○ "has a"

◉ "is a"

○ "contains a"

○ "looks like a"

**Explanation:** Correct. The litmus test for whether two classes should be in an inheritance relationship is if you can affirm "subclass **_is a_** superclass."

---

**2. Inheritance 2**

`Rectangle` inherits from (extends) which classes?

	Select all correct options

□ String

■ Object

■ Shape

□ Square

□ Triangle

□ Ellipse

**Explanation:** A class inherits from every class "above" it in the hierarchy. `Object` is implicitly at the top of the class hierarchy.

**Inheritance 3**

When a subclass provides a different implementation for a method of its superclass, this is called:

○ method overloading

◉ method overriding

○ method inheritance

○ method replacement

**Explanation:** Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that's defined in the superclass.

Refer to the following code for questions 4-6:

```java
// ###########################
// Alpha.java
// ###########################
public class Alpha {
    public String getOpinion( ) {
        return "Alpha is best!";
    }
}

// ###########################
// Bravo.java
// ###########################
public class Bravo extends Alpha {
     public String getOpinion( ) {
          return "Bravo is best!";
     }
}

// ###########################
// Charlie.java
// ###########################
public class Charlie extends Bravo {

}

// ###########################
// Delta.java
// ###########################
public class Delta extends Alpha {

}
```

**Inheritance 4**

What value is returned by calling the `getOpinion()` method on an instance of Alpha?

◉ "Alpha is best!"

○ "Bravo is best!"

○ "Charlie is best!"

○ "Delta is best!"

**Explanation:** `Alpha` doesn't explicitly extend any other class and uses its own implementation of `getOpinion()` which returns `"Alpha is best!"`.

---

**Inheritance 5**

What value is returned by calling the `getOpinion()` method on an instance of Charlie?

○ "Alpha is best!"

◉ "Bravo is best!"

○ "Charlie is best!"

○ "Delta is best!"

**Explanation:** `Bravo` extends `Alpha` and overrides `Alpha`'s `getOpinion()` with its own implementation of `getOpinion()` which returns `"Bravo is best!"`.

---

**Inheritance 6**

What value is returned by calling the `getOpinion()` method on an instance of Delta?

◉ "Alpha is best!"

○ "Bravo is best!"

○ "Charlie is best!"

○ "Delta is best!"

**Explanation:** `Delta` extends `Alpha` and inherits `Alpha`'s implementation of `getOpinion()` which returns `"Alpha is best!"`.

---

**Inheritance 7**

Consider the following class definitions:

```java
// Rectangle.java
public class Rectangle {
    private int length;
    private int width;

    // Constructor
    public Rectangle(int length, int width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public int getArea() {
        return this.length * this.width;
    }
}

// Square.java
public class Square extends Rectangle {

    // Constructor
    public Square(int edgeLength) {
        // What code should be added here?
    }
}
```

What must you add to the Square constructor to make this code work properly?

○ `new Rectangle(length, width);`

◉ `super(edgeLength, edgeLength);`

○ `Rectangle(edgeLength, edgeLength);`

○ `this(length, width);`

○ Nothing needs to be added, this code works properly.

**Explanation:** The special `super()` method allows code in the subclass constructor to call a superclass constructor. In this case, since the `Square` constructor defines only one parameter (the length of any edge), it calls the `Rectangle` constructor using `super()`, passing in the edge length as both the length and width of the rectangle.
