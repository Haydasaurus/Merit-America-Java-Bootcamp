# Welcome to Bootcamp OS

Congratulations on your decision to enroll in this coding bootcamp course. Before you learn how to code, you need to understand how you'll interact with the course materials and the software platform that delivers them. This type of software is known as a **Learning Management System** or LMS.

## What's an LMS?
An LMS is a software application used in educational courses and learning programs. It provides several functions such as delivery and grading of learning materials and reporting course progress.

## Bootcamp OS
The LMS platform you'll use in this course is **Bootcamp OS**. You'll use Bootcamp OS to access your reading materials, take quizzes, and submit your exercises. You'll find explanations for these topics later in this guide.

When you first log in to Bootcamp OS, you'll see the **curriculum overview** page. This page contains several elements:
-   The course you're enrolled in
-   One or more sections
-   One or more units in each section
-   Checkpoint average
-   Course progress

The following screenshot is a sample of the curriculum overview page. Your course and unit names may be different:

### Bootcamp OS terminology
As you complete the course, you may read or hear your instructor refer to the following terms:
-   **Unit**: A grouping of learning content for a single topic. Often contains reading material, a tutorial, a quiz, and a set of exercises.
-   **Section**: A grouping of related units.
-   **Course**: The term used to encompass all learning content for an entire class.
-   **Checkpoint**: The graded portion of a unit, typically the unit exercise. Not all units have checkpoints.

# Units and lessons

## Units
As mentioned on the previous page, a **unit** is a grouping of learning content for a single topic. You'll often focus on one unit at a time. In some situations, a unit exists as a pre-requisite for learning other topics.

The curriculum overview page shows your progress for each unit, with either your checkpoint score or a checkmark for units without checkpoints. If you're partially through a unit, it displays a progress bar and the remaining items left to complete:

![Unit progress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/163681919-fa12c9d1-0002-4366-9536-48d2aab5fcc2.png)

When you open a unit, Bootcamp OS presents the unit's contents on the left sidebar:

![Unit overview page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/163681936-fece370f-6a1a-4cd2-aa07-3f983400c533.png)

A checkmark indicates that you've read a page. A star indicates the unit checkpoint.

## Lessons
In Bootcamp OS, each page of reading material is called a **lesson**. Units typically contain several lessons.

Lessons give you the information you need to start working with a topic. Each lesson explains how a particular topic fits into software development, what problem it solves in the real world, along with code samples to help you apply it.

The content in the lessons is enough to complete your tutorial, quiz, and exercise. They may include links to documentation or other references if you want to learn more about certain concepts.

In software development, there are often many techniques and options to solve a particular problem. Lessons won't describe all of these. Instead, they'll show you how to accomplish a task most understandably and straightforwardly. They're not the end. They're the starting point.

# Tutorials

As a software developer, you'll often learn new concepts and technologies from tutorials. Most units in Bootcamp OS include tutorials providing you an opportunity for hands-on coding practice. Each tutorial presents a problem and walks you through solving it with code, step by step.

Tutorials aren't exhaustive. A tutorial's goal is to provide a basic example, helping you apply what you learned so that you can understand its use.

## Working through the tutorials
Every tutorial includes a `README.md` file explaining what you'll accomplish, along with instructions for working through the code. This file also tells you how to open the code and any other steps you need to take to get started.

Some tutorials include existing code. When this is the case, the instructions contain explanations for any existing code so you can understand how everything works together.

Each tutorial also includes the completed solution that you can refer to if you get stuck.

## How to access tutorials
Your course instructor will place these tutorials in your student repository in Git. You'll learn about repositories and how to access them in the Intro to Tools: Git unit.

# Quizzes

Quizzes help you understand how well you've learned the learning objectives from the unit. Overall, they have no impact on your academic standing.

Each quiz typically contains 7-10 questions. These questions aren't focusing on your ability to memorize specific terms or details. Each question validates your comprehension of the reading material and the concepts applied in the tutorial.

Most quiz questions are one of these four types: multiple choice, short answer, "select all that apply", and placing items in the correct order.

As you submit each answer, you'll receive immediate feedback on whether your answer was correct. You may submit answers more than once until you get the right answer.

You can use the feedback you received on the quiz to help you identify which topics that you need to review before moving forward. Your instructor uses this feedback during the lecture to determine which topics require additional focus.

# Lectures

No amount of reading or code-along tutorial replaces the learning you can obtain from live instruction. As you work through the course material, you'll participate in lectures led by professional software developers. They'll rely on their experience to create interactive classroom discussions that provide context so that you can better understand the material.

## Preparing for class
Your instructors expect you to work through the relevant self-study materials before attending class. Self-study materials include reading the lessons, completing the tutorials, and taking the quiz.

Take notes when you read or do something in the self-study materials that isn't clear. Your answers on the quiz inform the instructor which concepts to reinforce and where they can spend more time in class.

## What to expect during the lecture
While in class, you'll participate in an interactive discussion with your instructor. They'll share real-world examples that help you better understand the learning objectives. They'll also demonstrate the concept with an additional coding example.

Some instructors may distribute additional materials, such as slides or diagrams, to help drive the lecture. Others may rely primarily on a whiteboard to teach. You'll get the most out of the discussion when you follow along, ask questions for clarity, and attempt to demonstrate your understanding in your own words.

# Exercises

Most of the units in this course include exercises that simulate the types of tasks you'll encounter as a software developer. Unlike the quizzes, exercises expect you to identify a programmatic way of solving a problem, often through logic and reasoning. You'll use information learned from the current unit as well as previous lessons to build your solution.

## Types of exercises
Throughout the course, you may encounter different types of coding activities:
-   **Individual assignment**: A lab-based activity that assesses your understanding of the objectives associated with a specific lesson.
-   **Programming projects**: A project, individual or group-based, requiring you to develop a technical solution that addresses a specific problem.

When you see or hear **_scored exercises_**, it refers to an individual assignment.

## How to access exercises
Your instructor will place these exercises in your student repository in Git. You'll learn about repositories and how to access them in the Intro to Tools: Git unit.

## Grading policy
Most exercises you complete during the course leverage a concept known in software development as **_test automation_** to provide an automatic score. Test automation is the practice of programmatically testing code to verify its correctness.

If an exercise doesn't include automated tests, your instructor grades it after you submit it.

Exercise scores use the following scale:
-   **Not attempted (0 points)**: The code contains compilation errors, or no meaningful attempt was made to complete the assignment.
-   **Attempted (1 point)**: A meaningful attempt was made to complete the assignment that demonstrates a partial understanding of the concepts. For assignments with automated tests, at least 25% of the provided tests pass.
-   **Comprehension (2 points)**: The submitted solution demonstrates a substantial understanding of the concepts. For assignments with automated tests, at least 50% of the provided tests pass.
-   **Mastered (3 points)**: The solution submitted demonstrates a mastery of concepts and conforms to the best practices shown in the lessons. For assignments with automated tests, at least 90% of the provided tests pass.

You'll see your final score next to each unit on the curriculum overview page:

![Final exercise score](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/163681981-f6791044-c491-49fb-ac1d-1114ea4f9e4c.png)

## Receiving feedback
Your instructor may provide additional feedback about the quality of the code submission. Their feedback will help you improve the clarity of your code or identify a more direct way to approach the solution and comes from years of professional experience.

You'll find applying their feedback makes you a better software developer.

## Asking for help
Depending on the topic, you may find some exercises take several hours to complete. When you find yourself stuck and unable to make progress, reach out for assistance.

Start first by posting a message in Slack to see if someone else has encountered the same issue. Explain your problem and include any approaches you've tried.

When you ask someone else for help, ask them if you can describe your thought process. While you shouldn't ask to see another student's solution, you can walk them through your code. As you do, try to explain what's happening on each line. The other person may be able to identify the bug so that you can fix it.
