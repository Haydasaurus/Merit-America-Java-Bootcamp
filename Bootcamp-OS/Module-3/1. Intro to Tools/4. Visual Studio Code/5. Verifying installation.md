# Verifying installation

To confirm you have VS Code installed on your computer, run this command:

```
code --version
```

That outputs several lines of information like this:

```
1.54.3
2b9aebd5354a3629c3aba0a5f5df49f43d6689f8
x64
```

The first line (in this example `1.54.3`) is the version number. As long as the combined major.minor version is `1.51` or higher, you're all set.

You can also confirm the VS Code extensions installed by running this command:

```
code --list-extensions
```

The output may list several extensions and look something like this:

```
dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
octref.vetur
ritwickdey.LiveServer
```
