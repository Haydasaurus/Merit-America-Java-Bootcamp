# Introduction to Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code—also referred to as VS Code—is a free, lightweight, source code editor from Microsoft. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and supports several languages like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Support for many other languages can be added on through extensions. It's a popular choice among programmers in general, and is widely used in web development.

As a developer, you'll use several of VS Code's key features:

-   Projects
-   Terminal
-   Extensions

## Launching VS Code

To open VS Code, you can click on the VS Code icon from where you normally launch applications, like the Windows Start menu or macOS Applications folder. This launches the application, however, nothing is opened.

You can open and close individual files, but VS Code works best when you have a project open. You'll learn what projects are and how to open them in the next lesson.
