# Introduction

DOM stands for the **Document Object Model**. It's the browser's internal representation of the structure of the current web page. This unit discusses the DOM, what it is, and how to change it using JavaScript to make your pages more interactive and dynamic.

The DOM is an internal data structure that browsers use to represent the structure and content of a web page. When the browser loads an HTML document, it needs to translate that into something that it can use to draw a graphical representation of the page.

The DOM is arranged as a **tree structure**, which is a hierarchical model of parent and child elements. This is similar to how you've seen in HTML where elements are contained within other elements, like `li` in a `ul` or `ol`.

For instance, you might write the following HTML:

```html
<p>
    This is a paragraph. And it has <strong>bold</strong>
    elements and <em>emphasized</em> elements.
</p>
```

Rendered by a web browser, it looks like this:
