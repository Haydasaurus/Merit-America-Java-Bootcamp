# Introduction

DOM stands for the **Document Object Model**. It's the browser's internal representation of the structure of the current web page. This unit discusses the DOM, what it is, and how to change it using JavaScript to make your pages more interactive and dynamic.

The DOM is an internal data structure that browsers use to represent the structure and content of a web page. When the browser loads an HTML document, it needs to translate that into something that it can use to draw a graphical representation of the page.

The DOM is arranged as a **tree structure**, which is a hierarchical model of parent and child elements. This is similar to how you've seen in HTML where elements are contained within other elements, like `li` in a `ul` or `ol`.

For instance, you might write the following HTML:

```html
<p>
    This is a paragraph. And it has <strong>bold</strong>
    elements and <em>emphasized</em> elements.
</p>
```

Rendered by a web browser, it looks like this:

![Rendered HTML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176943690-3aa82606-43b7-4b51-a732-29f4b3a9a517.png)

# How Does the DOM Work?

Understanding the DOM is important. HTML is static. It's only read once when the page loads, and then it's converted into a DOM. CSS and JavaScript perform their tasks using the DOM, not the static HTML.

![HTML to DOM to Graphical View](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176943907-dbfbbebb-6881-4c17-8724-9d342e305128.svg)

This can be most clearly seen when creating a table.

Most developers write the HTML for a table like this:

```html
<table class="demo">
    <tr>
        <td>This is a table cell.</td>
        <td>This is another table cell.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

The browser reads in this HTML and shows you exactly what you'd expect: a table with one row and two cells. But if you right click on the page and select "Inspect Element", you'll see that the DOM looks different:

![DOM for a table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176943940-e0ddcaaf-aec9-4f99-bb42-32075cf2d6c7.png)

You'll notice that there's a `tbody` element in the DOM that doesn't appear in the HTML code. Where did it come from?

The browser added it while parsing the HTML code into its DOM representation. All tables have a `tbody`, even if it doesn't actually appear in the HTML code.

The browsers sometimes makes small adjustments to the HTML to best fit what it expects from the DOM. In this case, the browser added a `tbody` even though the HTML didn't have one.

This example also shows another issue. If you write the following CSS, nothing happens:

```css
table > tr > td {
  background-color: red;
}
```

You might expect this style to be applied to the table cells because you wrote the HTML as `td` elements being direct children of the `tr` element, which is also a direct child of `table`.

But CSS doesn't run on the HTML—it runs on the _DOM_. And the DOM has a `tbody` element in-between the `table` and the `tr`. So, to apply a style to the `td` elements, you'd use the following CSS:

```css
table > tbody > tr > td {
  background-color: red;
}
```

## Checking the DOM

So, if the DOM doesn't always match the HTML source code, how can you reliably interact with it using CSS and JavaScript? Fortunately, you can view the DOM in the browser.

To do that, open the developer tools in Firefox or Chrome and go to the Inspector (Firefox) or the Elements (Chrome) tab. This shows an HTML-like view of the DOM as it is at that moment. If you change any JavaScript or CSS in your code, you'll see those changes happen immediately in that view.

This is the best way to understand how your browser interprets the HTML source code and how it changes due to live user interaction.

>**✔ Tip: Always check the browser**
>
>If you're having problems getting a page to behave properly or display correctly, always look at the browser and its DOM representation. Often developers go back to the HTML or JavaScript source code to try and figure out what's going on, but the browser is where your code runs, so always check there first.

# Selecting DOM Elements

To create a truly dynamic web application, you'll need to know how to change the DOM after your page has loaded.

When you interact with the DOM, you can do things like add new elements, hide existing elements, even move or change elements. Things like that help you create dynamic user experiences.

For example, if you've ever ordered something online, the website might have had separate forms for your shipping and billing information, with a checkbox to indicate the information was the same so you didn't need to type the same information again. When you selected that checkbox, it filled out your information in the second form, and maybe hid it from view too. That feature was possible because JavaScript interacted with the DOM.

JavaScript has many built-in functions that you can use to manipulate the DOM. The next section contains a list of the most commonly used functions.

## `getElementById()`

The first function you'll learn about is `getElementById()`. This function gets a single HTML element from the DOM and returns a reference to it.

Imagine that you have the following HTML:

```html
<h1 id="title">Welcome</h1>
```

You can select that from the created DOM with this code:

```js
let titleElement = document.getElementById('title');
```

>**⚠ Warning: IDs on elements must be unique**
>
>If you haven't been doing it already, start making all IDs unique in your code. There must never be more than one element on a page with the same ID. As you start to use more functions in JavaScript that rely on element IDs, you'll understand why.
>
>If there's more than one element on the page that has the same ID, the `getElementById()` function returns the first element it finds with the requested ID.

## `querySelector()`

`querySelector()` is for selecting single elements that don't have an ID. `querySelector()` takes a standard CSS selector and returns the _first_ element it finds that matches that selector.

For instance, imagine that you have the following HTML:

```html
<ul id="todo-list">
    <li class="todo">Walk the dog</li>
    <li class="todo">Mow the lawn</li>
    <li class="todo">Go shopping</li>
</ul>
```

You can select the _first_ list item by calling `querySelector()` with the `.todo` selector:

```js
let firstListItem = document.querySelector('.todo');
```

You can also call `querySelector()` on any element, and it searches within that element. That means you could do the same thing with this:

```js
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');
let firstListItem = todoList.querySelector('.todo');
```

That would be helpful if you used the `todo` class elsewhere, and you want to narrow your selection down to the `todo-list`.

>**✔ Tip: What's the difference between querySelector('#id') and getElementById('id')?**
>
>You could use either, but using `querySelector()` to select on an ID is much slower than calling `getElementById()`. If you only need to get a single element and it has an ID, it's best to use `getElementById()`. Use `querySelector()` for selecting single elements without IDs.

## `querySelectorAll()`

If you want to get _all_ of the list items, you can use `querySelectorAll()` instead. This returns a `NodeList` of all the elements, which you can use as an array:

```js
let allListItems = document.querySelectorAll('.todo');
```

Like `querySelector()`, you can use this to select inside another element:

```js
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');
let allListItems = todoList.querySelectorAll('.todo');
```

You can loop through the `NodeList` and access items like you can with an array:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < allListItems.length; i++) {
  console.log(allListItems[i]);
}
```

---

# Changing DOM Elements

Once you've selected an element, you can change it by accessing its properties.

## Changing text with `innerText`

You can change the text inside of an element using the element's `innerText` property:

```js
// Get the first list item
let firstListItem = document.querySelector('.todo');

// Change it to say 'Update documentation'
firstListItem.innerText = 'Update documentation';
```

Be cautious of what elements you use `innerText` on. Because you can use it on any element—even ones that don't normally have their own text such as `ul`—it'll overwrite child elements if there are any.

For example, if you set `innerText` on a `ul`, the list items are overwritten:

```js
// Get the list
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

// Change list to say 'Update documentation',
// all list items are lost in the process
todoList.innerText = 'Update documentation';
```

Refer to the following table for what the rendered output and the DOM look like before and after running `todoList.innerText = 'Update documentation'`:

![Before and after running innerText for a list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176944217-f5ecda57-46c6-45ec-b0e7-d5c29968d838.png)

It's important to note that `innerText` puts the literal text of what you type in into the DOM element. That means if you enter HTML to the `innerText` property, it displays the HTML to the user and doesn't render it as DOM elements:

```js
// Get the list
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

// User will see '<li>Update documentation</li>',
// and will not create a new line item
todoList.innerText = '<li>Update documentation</li>';
```

## Changing HTML with `innerHTML`

`innerHTML` acts like `innerText`, but it _does_ render HTML added as DOM elements:

```js
// Get the list
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

// User will see 'Update documentation'
// within a newly created list item
todoList.innerHTML = '<li>Update documentation</li>';
```

Like `innerText`, this overwrites any other content and children items. After running this example, `todoList` only has one list item.

>**⚠ Danger: Be careful when using innerHTML**
>
>Anything passed to `innerHTML` is read and rendered into the living DOM of the browser. It's dangerous to take user input and use `innerHTML` to put it into an element. A malicious user can use this to perform what's called a **Cross Site Scripting** attack, or XSS.
>
>If a user can add HTML to your page, that means that they can embed JavaScript into your page using a `<script>` element. Then they can use all these methods to completely rewrite your page, including making it look like a login page that sends usernames and passwords to their own site instead of yours.
>
>Never send user-inputted data to an `innerHTML`. When taking user input, always use `innerText` to add their content to a DOM element.

## Getting and setting input element values with `value` and `checked`

You can get the current value of an input element with its `value` property:

```js
// Get an input element
let todoInput = document.querySelector('input[name=newTodo]');

// Get the text the user typed into the input field
let newTodoText = todoInput.value;
```

You can also set the value of an input field by assigning a new value to the `value` property:

```js
// Assign the value of someVariable to input field
todoInput.value = someVariable;

// You can also empty the text field by setting it to an empty string
todoInput.value = '';
```

>**⚠ Warning: Some select boxes have multiple values**
>
>While this also works for `select` elements, it's possible for `select` inputs to be configured to have more than one value selected. `value` only gives you back the _first_ selected value. To get them all, access the `selectedOptions` property instead.

For radio and checkbox elements, you can get their status with `checked`:

```js
let finishedCheckbox = document.querySelector('input[name=isFinished]');

let isFinished = finishedCheckbox.checked;
```

`checked` returns a boolean: true for checked and false for unchecked.

## Adding and removing classes with `classList`

All elements have a property called `classList` that allows you to see, add, and remove classes from the element. This is the main way that you'll change how something looks on the page using JavaScript.

```js
// Get the first line item
let firstListItem = document.querySelector('.todo');

// Add the class `done`
firstListItem.classList.add('done');

// Remove the class `priority`
firstListItem.classList.remove('priority');
```

The `classList` property returns a `DOMTokenList`, which you can iterate through and access values like an array:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < firstListItem.classList.length; i++){
  console.log(firstListItem.classList[i]);
}
```

# Creating DOM Elements

Instead of supplying HTML to `innerHTML` to create DOM elements, you can create DOM elements directly using `createElement()`:

```js
let newListItem = document.createElement('li');
newListItem.innerText = 'Update documentation';
```

`createElement()` creates a new DOM element and returns it. You can then call all the normal functions on that element that you can call on any DOM element, like `innerText`.

This element isn't on the page yet, so it won't show up to the user until you insert it into the living DOM.

## `insertAdjacentElement()`

You add new elements to the DOM with the `insertAdjacentElement()` method. You call the method on another element that exists in the DOM, either a sibling element or parent element. You pass it two parameters: the location and the element to add.

The location parameter is a string that represents the location you want to insert the new element relative to the element you call `insertAdjacentElement` on. The string can be one of four possible values:

| **Location**    | **Meaning**                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `'beforebegin'` | Insert the element before this one                    |
| `'afterbegin'`  | Insert the element inside this one as the first child |
| `'beforeend'`   | Insert the element inside this one as the last child  |
| `'afterend'`    | Insert the element after this one                     |

### `beforebegin`

You can add an element immediately before another one with the `beforebegin`:

```js
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

let newHeader = document.createElement('h2');
newHeader.innerText = 'Todo List';

// Place the header before the list
todoList.insertAdjacentElement('beforebegin', newHeader);
```

### `afterbegin`

You can add new DOM nodes to the beginning of your list with `afterbegin`:

```js
let newListItem = document.createElement('li');
newListItem.innerText = 'Update documentation';

let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');
todoList.insertAdjacentElement('afterbegin', newListItem);
```

This adds the element as the first child on the element with the ID of `'todo-list'`, right after the list begins.

### `beforeend`

To add the element to the end of your list, you can use `beforeend`:

```js
let newListItem = document.createElement('li');
newListItem.innerText = 'Update documentation';

let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');
todoList.insertAdjacentElement('beforeend', newListItem);
```

This puts the element as the last child in the list, right before the list ends.

### `afterend`

You can add an element immediately after another one with the `afterend`:

```js
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

let newFooter = document.createElement('h2');
newFooter.innerText = 'End of List';

// Place the footer after the list
todoList.insertAdjacentElement('afterend', newFooter);
```

# Traversing the DOM

There may be times when you don't know which selector to choose an element with, or you need to work with a specific child of an element and need to loop through or walk through a list of elements. For this, you can use some element properties to get an element's children or parent.

## Selecting children with children and childNodes

If you select an element:

```js
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');
```

You can get all of its immediate children **_elements_** through the `children` property:

```js
let todoItems = todoList.children;
```

`children` returns an `HTMLCollection` object, which you can turn into a real array with access to `map`, `forEach`, and all the other array functions with this:

```js
let todoItemsArray = Array.from(todoList.children);
```

You can also get children by calling `childNodes`:

```js
let todoNodes = todoList.childNodes;
```

This returns a `NodeList` object that contains all the **_nodes_** inside that element. You can also pass this to `Array.from()` to get a normal JavaScript array.

### What's the difference between `children` and `childNodes`?

`children` returns **elements** that are children of this element. That means that it only contains other HTML elements and **_not_** the text that might be in the element.

`childNodes` returns **nodes** that are children of this element. That _includes_ text (including whitespace) and comments that are in the DOM.

For example, if you had the following DOM structure:

```html
<p id="message">
  This is an <strong>awesome</strong> paragraph.
  <!-- with a comment -->
</p>
```

Calling `children` on the `p` element returns one child: the `strong` element. `children` only returns the children DOM elements. There's only one element inside the `p`, and that's the `strong` element.

Calling `childNodes` on the `p` element returns five children. The first is a text node containing 'This is an ', the next is a strong element, the next is another text node containing ' paragraph.', then a comment node holding 'with a comment', and finally a text node that holds the newline after the comment.

The one that you use depends on what you want to do.

## Getting an element's `parentNode`

You can access an element's parent using the `parentNode` attribute:

```js
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');
let todoListsParent = todoList.parentNode;
```

## Getting adjacent elements with `nextElementSibling` and `previousElementSibling`

You can select the next and previous sibling—an element that has the same parent—by using the `nextElementSibling` and `previousElementSibling` properties:

```js
// Get the first line item of the todo list
let firstTodo = document.querySelector('.todo');

// Get the next line item
let secondTodo = firstTodo.nextElementSibling;
let thirdTodo = secondTodo.nextElementSibling;
```

## Removing elements with `removeChild()`

You can remove elements with the `removeChild()` method:

```js
// Get the todo list
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

// Remove the first item
todoList.removeChild(todoList.children[0]);
```

Notice that you remove a DOM element by calling `removeChild()` from its parent. In the preceding example, `todoList` is the parent element and `removeChild()` deletes the first of its children.

You can remove an element even if you don't know the name of its parent element. Use `parentNode` to reference the parent of the element that you want to remove, then call `removeChild()` from it:

```js
// Get the first line item of the todo list
let firstTodo = document.querySelector('.todo');

// Remove it, using its parent property
firstTodo.parentNode.removeChild(firstTodo);
```

## **DOM 2**

**You can see an accurate representation of the DOM in:**

○ any text editor

◉ developer tools in a browser

○ HTML files

○ JavaScript files

**Explanation:** A browser's developer tools provide an interactive view of the current state of the DOM.


## **DOM 3**

**Displaying user input with `innerHTML` is dangerous because:**

○ `innerHTML` replaces other content and child items

◉ the user could inject malicious JavaScript into your page

○ the user could add new nodes to the DOM

○ the user could style their own input with CSS

**Explanation:** It's dangerous to take user input and use `innerHTML` to put it into an element. A malicious user can use this to perform what's called a **Cross Site Scripting** attack, or XSS.


## **DOM 4**

**True or False: After the browser creates the DOM, JavaScript can change it at any time.**

◉ True

○ False

**Explanation:** By using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, you can do things like add new elements, hide existing elements, even move or change elements. Things like that help you create dynamic user experiences.


## **DOM 5**

**Which of the following statements gets a reference to the first `li` in the list?**

```css
<ul id="numbers">
    <li id="one">One</li>
    <li id="two">Two</li>
    <li id="three">Three</li>
</ul>
```

○ `document.querySelectorAll('li')`

◉ `document.querySelector('li')`

○ `document.getElementById('li')`

○ `ul.innerHTML`

**Explanation:** `querySelector()` is for selecting single elements that don't have an ID. `querySelector()` takes a standard CSS selector and returns a reference to the first element it finds that matches that selector.


## **DOM 6**

**Which of the following statements is another way to get a reference to the first `li` in the list?**

```css
<ul id="numbers">
    <li id="one">One</li>
    <li id="two">Two</li>
    <li id="three">Three</li>
</ul>
```

○ `document.createElement('li')`

○ `document.querySelectorAll('li')`

◉ `document.getElementById('one')`

○ `document.getElementById('numbers')`

**Explanation:** `getElementById('one')` gets a reference to the first `li` since it's the element with the id `one`.


## **DOM 7**

**Which of the following statements returns a list of the `li` elements?**

```css
<ul id="numbers">
    <li id="one">One</li>
    <li id="two">Two</li>
    <li id="three">Three</li>
</ul>
```

◉ `document.querySelectorAll('li')`

○ `document.querySelector('li')`

○ `document.getElementById('li')`

○ `document.querySelectorAll('ul')`

**Explanation:** querySelectorAll('li') returns a NodeList of all the li elements that your code can iterate through with forEach().


## **DOM 8**

**Which of the following statements is another way to get a list of the `li` elements?**

```css
<ul id="numbers">
    <li id="one">One</li>
    <li id="two">Two</li>
    <li id="three">Three</li>
</ul>
```

○ `document.querySelector('ul li')`

○ `document.querySelectorAll('ul')`

◉ `document.getElementById('numbers').children`

○ `document.querySelector('li').parentNode`

**Explanation:** The `children` property of the `ul` element retrieved by `getElementById('numbers')` is a `HTMLCollection` of all the `li` elements that your code can turn into an array and iterate through with `forEach()`.


## **DOM 9**

**If you wanted to add the element referenced by `newLi` to the end of the following list, which statement does that?**

```css
<ul id="numbers">
    <li id="one">One</li>
    <li id="two">Two</li>
    <li id="three">Three</li>
</ul>
```

◉ `document.getElementById('numbers').insertAdjacentElement('beforeend', newLi);`

○ `document.getElementById('numbers').insertAdjacentElement('afterend', newLi);`

○ `document.getElementById('numbers').createElement(newLi);`

○ `document.getElementById('three').nextElementSibling = newLi;`

**Explanation:** `getElementById('numbers')` gets a reference to the `ul` element and `insertAdjacentElement('beforeend', newLi)` adds the `newLi` element as its last child.
