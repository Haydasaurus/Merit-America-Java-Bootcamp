# Working with fonts

One of the first things you might want to do when styling your web page is to change some of the properties related to fonts.

In the previous section, you learned that the browser supplies a default style sheet, and each browser vendor supplies their own. This means that if you're viewing a web page in Chrome on macOS, the default browser font is Times. How can you change that to something else?

You can start by using the `body` selector. The body itself doesn't have any text, but this style applies to the body and each element that's a descendant, or child, of it, which is every element. The property that you'll change is `font-family`, and the value that you'll set it to is `Arial, Helvitica, sans-serif`:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvitica, sans-serif;
}
```

You might wonder why `font-family` has three values. As you'll learn in the next lesson, there are very few fonts that everyone has universally installed on their machines. What you're declaring here are fallbacks in case the visitor doesn't have the specified font. If they have Arial, their browser uses that. If not, it'll try Helvetica; if that fails, it defaults to a generic sans-serif font.

If you look at this in the browser, you'll see the difference between the default Times and Arial.

>🛈 Tip: Sans-serif versus serif
>
>Sans-Serif and Serif are two categories of fonts that you'll come across when building web pages. A serif is a decorative stroke that finishes off the end of a letter's stem, sometimes also called the “feet” of the letters. In turn, a serif font is a font that has serifs, while a sans-serif is a font that doesn't, which is why it's called "sans-serif."

## Web safe fonts

To use a font on a website, that font must exist on a visitor's machine. But what if it isn't? Then the visitor's browser defaults to a font like Times. To avoid this, it's best to use **web safe fonts**. Every device that accesses your website has these fonts, so they're safe to use. Here's a list of web safe fonts:

-   **Serif Fonts**
    -   "Times New Roman", Times, serif
    -   Georgia, serif
    -   "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif
-   **Sans-Serif Fonts**
    -   Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
    -   "Arial Black", Gadget, sans-serif
    -   "Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif
    -   Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif
    -   "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif
    -   Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif
    -   "Trebuchet MS", Helvetica, sans-serif
    -   Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif
-   **Monospace Fonts**
    -   "Courier New", Courier, monospace
    -   "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace

As you can see, this list is small. What happens when you want to diverge from this list?

## Web fonts

There are many web font providers available, with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) being the most popular. Google Fonts allows you to add beautiful typography to your website by including a link to the font's style sheet.

All the fonts in the Google Fonts catalog are free and open source. These fonts use cross-site caching, which means you only need to load a font once with any website. That same cached font can be used on any other website that uses Google Fonts. This means that by the time someone visits your site, there is a good chance they've already loaded your font.

Start by browsing through the Google Fonts catalog until you find one you like and click on it. In this example, you'll use a popular font called [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) .

When you click on the style, you'll see multiple styles you can choose from. Make sure to only select the styles you'll use. Even with caching in place, you'll want to be careful about how many fonts you add to your website. The more fonts you use, the larger your page will be.

A good rule of thumb is to stick to one or two fonts. When you've selected your fonts, you'll see an embed tab on the right side of the page. If you click on it, you'll see some code that you can copy and paste into your style sheet.

Copy the `<link>` tag into your HTML document and place it in the `<head>`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Basics</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
  </head>
</html>
```

Next, update your selector to use the new font family:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```

Now, your page uses the new Roboto web font.

## Font properties

So far, you have only seen one property related to fonts. In this section, you'll learn about some other font properties.

### Font size

The `font-size` property defines the size of the text. This value can be one of any number of units of measurement, which you'll learn about in a later unit. For now, you'll use pixels:

```css
body {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

> The default font-size is 16px, so this is only slightly larger than the default.

### Font weight

The `font-weight` property defines the weight of the text. You can use values like `normal` and `bold` with this property:

-   `font-weight: normal`: The text is normal weight.
-   `font-weight: bold`: The text is bold.

```css
p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

You can also use numerical values:

-   100 Thin
-   200 Extra Light
-   300 Light
-   400 Normal
-   500 Medium
-   600 Semi Bold
-   700 Bold
-   800 Extra Bold
-   900 Ultra Bold

```css
p {
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

> If the font family doesn't provide the requested weight, it uses the closest available one.

### Font style

The `font-style` property specifies the amount of slant the text has:

-   `font-style: normal`: The text isn't slanted.
-   `font-style: italic`: The letters are slightly slanted.
-   `font-style: oblique`: The letters are more slanted than italic.

```
p {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

### Line height

The `line-height` property defines the height of a single line of text:

-   `line-height: normal`: Reverts to the default value of the browser.
-   `line-height: 1.6`: You can use unitless values; the line height is relative to the font size.
-   `line-height: 30px`: You can use pixel values.

### Text align

The `text-align` property defines how the text content of the element is horizontally aligned:

-   `text-align: left`: Align the text content to the left.
-   `text-align: right`: Align the text content to the right.
-   `text-align: center`: Center the text content.
-   `text-align: justify`: Justify the text content.

### Text decoration

The `text-decoration` property defines how to decorate the text content of the element, specifically with an underline or overline:

-   `text-decoration: none`: Removes any text decoration.
-   `text-decoration: underline`: Underlines the text content.

### Text transform

The `text-transform` property defines how to capitalize the text content of the element:

-   `text-transform: none`: Removes any text transformation; the text appears the same as in the HTML code.
-   `text-transform: capitalize`: Turns the first letter of each word into a capital letter.
-   `text-transform: uppercase`: Turns all letters into capital letters.
-   `text-transform: lowercase`: Turns all letters into lowercase letters.
