# Working with colors

If someone handed you the keys to a new car, you'd probably be excited to see it. But that excitement would quickly fade away when you step outside only to see that it's painted a bright, neon green, the carpet is a bright pink, and the car has yellow seat covers. You'd probably ask yourself, "Who designed this car?"

Color matters for the car, and it matters for your website. You must make sure that your designs are visually appealing and that you use color contrast throughout your website. **Color contrast** refers to the difference in light between font, or anything in the foreground, and its background. Try to keep that in mind when changing the colors of backgrounds and fonts.

## Background color

The `background-color` CSS property sets the background color of an element. If you want to change the background color for the entire document, you could target the body element and set the background color to `blue`:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvitica, sans-serif;
  /* we can use names or rgb hex values */
  background-color: blue;
}
```

Now that you've changed your background color to blue, the contrast with the black text doesn't look good. It'll be hard for your visitors to read the text on the page. If you want to check the contrast between text and background colors, you can use online tools like the [Coolors Color Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) .

## Color

You know the contrast between the blue background and black text isn't that great, so you need to change the color of the text. The `color` CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text. You can update the text on the page by setting the color property to white using the body selector:

```css
body {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```

This looks a lot better. Using color contrast in your designs improves the readability of the text on a page.

## Color values

You can now set the background color of any element along with the foreground color of an element's text. In the previous examples, you used names of colors like blue and white, but where did those come from?

There are several ways to define a color. Here are two of the most popular ways:

-   Using a keyword such as blue, white or transparent.
-   Using the RGB cubic-coordinate system through #-hexadecimal code.

### Color keywords

Color keywords are case-insensitive identifiers that represent a specific color, such as red, blue, black, or LightSeaGreen. There are several things to keep in mind when using color keywords:

-   CSS completely ignores unknown keywords.
-   The color keywords all represent plain, solid colors, without transparency.
-   Several keywords are aliases for each other:
    -   gray/grey
    -   lightgray/grey
    -   darkgray/darkgrey

Look at this code, which uses an incorrect `verybrightred` value for the `color` property:

```css
body {
  background-color: blue;
  color: verybrightred; /* this keyword is not valid, color reverts back to default of black */
}
```

See the [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) for a full list of color keywords.

### RGB hex

The RGB color model defines a given color according to its red, green, and blue components. If you want to set the background of your document to a `hotpink` color, you could define that using the hexadecimal `#FF0099`. The first two characters represent red, the middle two represent green, and the last two represent blue:

```
body {
  background-color: #ff0099;
}
```

Don't worry about memorizing these numbers. This is something you can lean on your tools to do for you. In Visual Studio Code, you can select a color from the palette, and it inserts the correct hex code for you.
