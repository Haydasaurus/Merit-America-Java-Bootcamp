# HTML and CSS

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks of the web. Each of these languages play their own significant roles in building the web:

-   HTML: Provides the basic structure or markup of a document.
-   CSS: Provides formatting of the document to control presentation and layout.
-   JavaScript: Provides behavior to the document.

Web development is about understanding each of these independently and how they work together to produce the web.
