# Intro to CSS

As you saw in the previous section, HTML on its own is functional, but not very stylish. HTML allows you to structure your documents, but **Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS) brings your web pages to life with layout and style. CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.

## Browser default style sheet

Before you learn how to create your own styles, you need to understand that there is some default styling applied to HTML. Imagine you have an HTML document with some headings, paragraphs, a list, and a link:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Basics</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CSS Basics</h1>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Neque tempora
      quasi doloribus labore, reprehenderit iste, aliquid, distinctio
      consectetur ipsum corrupti perferendis? Exercitationem quo dicta
      aspernatur recusandae possimus a cupiditate illum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quam, similique a
      aliquam quidem at nam sapiente nostrum, cum consequuntur enim repellendus
      saepe totam asperiores eaque tempore ipsa exercitationem, delectus
      voluptates.
    </p>

    <h2>Another heading</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>one</li>
      <li>two</li>
      <li>three</li>
    </ul>

    A link to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google.com</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

You'd see a web page that looks like this.

It doesn't look like much, but there are some default styles applied to this HTML:

-   The `<h1>` is larger than the `<h2>`.
-   The `<p>`s have some spacing between them.
-   The `<ul>` has some space between it and the `<h2>`.
-   The link is blue, making it stand out from the rest of the text.

If you open the Chrome Developer Tools and highlight the `<h1>` element, you'll see the style definitions to the right. For `<h1>`, you'll see `user agent stylesheet`, which means this is the default style, and it's coming from the browser.

## CSS documents

Now that you know where the default styles are coming from, you can learn how to create your own style sheets and override them. First, you need to create a new style sheet.

Usually you'd store your style sheets in a directory called `css`. You can call this whatever you want-in this example, it's called `styles.css`. Now, you have a directory structure that looks like this:

```
├── css
│   └── styles.css
└── index.html
```

You need a way to reference your style sheets in your HTML document. You can do this using a new HTML tag, the `<link>` tag. Remember: any metadata about your document or links to style sheets or JavaScript goes in the `<head>` section.

The HTML External Resource Link element, `<link>`, specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to style sheets, but it's also used to establish site icons—both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices—among other things.

Here you can see how to use the `<link>` element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Basics</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
  </head>
</html>
```

## CSS syntax

Now that you linked the HTML document to your style sheet, you can create your styles. The first thing you might want to do is to add comments. Open `styles.css` and add the following:

```css
/* this is a comment */
```

To create a new style, you need to start with a selector. CSS selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply. There are many selectors that you'll learn about later, but for now, you'll learn the most basic one, a type selector.

A type selector selects all elements that have the given tag name. Here are a few examples of type selectors:

```css
body {
  /* apply the following declarations to the body element */
}
h1 {
  /* apply the following declarations to all h1 elements */
}
p {
  /* apply the following declarations to all p elements */
}
```

The style declaration block contains one or more style declarations. Every style declaration consists of two parts: a property and a value. They're separated by a colon and end with a semi-colon:

```css
/* this is a comment */
body {
  /* style declarations */
  /* every style declaration consists of two parts: a property and a value */
  /* seperated by a colon */
  /* ends with a semi-colon */
  property: value;
}
h1 {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  property: value;
}
p {
  property: value;
}
```
