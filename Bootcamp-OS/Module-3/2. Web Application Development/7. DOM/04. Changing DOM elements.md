# Changing DOM elements

Once you've selected an element, you can change it by accessing its properties.

## Changing text with `innerText`

You can change the text inside of an element using the element's `innerText` property:

```js
// Get the first list item
let firstListItem = document.querySelector('.todo');

// Change it to say 'Update documentation'
firstListItem.innerText = 'Update documentation';
```

Be cautious of what elements you use `innerText` on. Because you can use it on any element—even ones that don't normally have their own text such as `ul`—it'll overwrite child elements if there are any.

For example, if you set `innerText` on a `ul`, the list items are overwritten:

```js
// Get the list
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

// Change list to say 'Update documentation',
// all list items are lost in the process
todoList.innerText = 'Update documentation';
```

Refer to the following table for what the rendered output and the DOM look like before and after running `todoList.innerText = 'Update documentation'`:

It's important to note that `innerText` puts the literal text of what you type in into the DOM element. That means if you enter HTML to the `innerText` property, it displays the HTML to the user and doesn't render it as DOM elements:

```js
// Get the list
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

// User will see '<li>Update documentation</li>',
// and will not create a new line item
todoList.innerText = '<li>Update documentation</li>';
```

## Changing HTML with `innerHTML`

`innerHTML` acts like `innerText`, but it _does_ render HTML added as DOM elements:

```js
// Get the list
let todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

// User will see 'Update documentation'
// within a newly created list item
todoList.innerHTML = '<li>Update documentation</li>';
```

Like `innerText`, this overwrites any other content and children items. After running this example, `todoList` only has one list item.

>⚠ Danger: Be careful when using innerHTML
>
>Anything passed to `innerHTML` is read and rendered into the living DOM of the browser. It's dangerous to take user input and use `innerHTML` to put it into an element. A malicious user can use this to perform what's called a **Cross Site Scripting** attack, or XSS.
>
>If a user can add HTML to your page, that means that they can embed JavaScript into your page using a `<script>` element. Then they can use all these methods to completely rewrite your page, including making it look like a login page that sends usernames and passwords to their own site instead of yours.
>
>Never send user-inputted data to an `innerHTML`. When taking user input, always use `innerText` to add their content to a DOM element.

## Getting and setting input element values with `value` and `checked`

You can get the current value of an input element with its `value` property:

```js
// Get an input element
let todoInput = document.querySelector('input[name=newTodo]');

// Get the text the user typed into the input field
let newTodoText = todoInput.value;
```

You can also set the value of an input field by assigning a new value to the `value` property:

```js
// Assign the value of someVariable to input field
todoInput.value = someVariable;

// You can also empty the text field by setting it to an empty string
todoInput.value = '';
```

>⚠ Warning: Some select boxes have multiple values
>
>While this also works for `select` elements, it's possible for `select` inputs to be configured to have more than one value selected. `value` only gives you back the _first_ selected value. To get them all, access the `selectedOptions` property instead.

For radio and checkbox elements, you can get their status with `checked`:

```js
let finishedCheckbox = document.querySelector('input[name=isFinished]');

let isFinished = finishedCheckbox.checked;
```

`checked` returns a boolean: true for checked and false for unchecked.

## Adding and removing classes with `classList`

All elements have a property called `classList` that allows you to see, add, and remove classes from the element. This is the main way that you'll change how something looks on the page using JavaScript.

```js
// Get the first line item
let firstListItem = document.querySelector('.todo');

// Add the class `done`
firstListItem.classList.add('done');

// Remove the class `priority`
firstListItem.classList.remove('priority');
```

The `classList` property returns a `DOMTokenList`, which you can iterate through and access values like an array:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < firstListItem.classList.length; i++){
  console.log(firstListItem.classList[i]);
}
```
