# How does the DOM work?

Understanding the DOM is important. HTML is static. It's only read once when the page loads, and then it's converted into a DOM. CSS and JavaScript perform their tasks using the DOM, not the static HTML.

This can be most clearly seen when creating a table.

Most developers write the HTML for a table like this:

```html
<table class="demo">
    <tr>
        <td>This is a table cell.</td>
        <td>This is another table cell.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

The browser reads in this HTML and shows you exactly what you'd expect: a table with one row and two cells. But if you right click on the page and select "Inspect Element", you'll see that the DOM looks different:

You'll notice that there's a `tbody` element in the DOM that doesn't appear in the HTML code. Where did it come from?

The browser added it while parsing the HTML code into its DOM representation. All tables have a `tbody`, even if it doesn't actually appear in the HTML code.

The browsers sometimes makes small adjustments to the HTML to best fit what it expects from the DOM. In this case, the browser added a `tbody` even though the HTML didn't have one.

This example also shows another issue. If you write the following CSS, nothing happens:

```css
table > tr > td {
  background-color: red;
}
```

You might expect this style to be applied to the table cells because you wrote the HTML as `td` elements being direct children of the `tr` element, which is also a direct child of `table`.

But CSS doesn't run on the HTML—it runs on the _DOM_. And the DOM has a `tbody` element in-between the `table` and the `tr`. So, to apply a style to the `td` elements, you'd use the following CSS:

```css
table > tbody > tr > td {
  background-color: red;
}
```

## Checking the DOM

So, if the DOM doesn't always match the HTML source code, how can you reliably interact with it using CSS and JavaScript? Fortunately, you can view the DOM in the browser.

To do that, open the developer tools in Firefox or Chrome and go to the Inspector (Firefox) or the Elements (Chrome) tab. This shows an HTML-like view of the DOM as it is at that moment. If you change any JavaScript or CSS in your code, you'll see those changes happen immediately in that view.

This is the best way to understand how your browser interprets the HTML source code and how it changes due to live user interaction.

>✔ Tip: Always check the browser

>If you're having problems getting a page to behave properly or display correctly, always look at the browser and its DOM representation. Often developers go back to the HTML or JavaScript source code to try and figure out what's going on, but the browser is where your code runs, so always check there first.
