# Flexbox

**Flexbox** is short for Flexible Box Module. It's a relatively new layout tool in CSS that provides a flexible way to arrange items on a page. Since its introduction several years ago, it has been steadily working its way into common usage in web development and is supported by nearly 98% of the available browsers.

Flexbox dynamically handles alignment and the space between page items, which helps to save time. It consists of a **_flex container_** that contains one or more **_flex items_** which are constrained in their layout within the container using various flexbox properties specified by the developer.

---

# Defining a Flexbox

Imagine that you have this traditional page layout, and you're asked to place items into the non-shaded areas. Those non-shaded areas become **_flexbox containers_**. The child elements within the **_flexbox container_** are **_flexbox items_**.

![Layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827731-53bc894f-4f25-49ce-95e1-b472ad25db2e.png)

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Flexbox is intended for sections of pages**
>
Typically, you don't use flexbox to layout an entire page, but to layout a group of like elements in one or more sections of the page.

For example, you might use the following HTML for the non-shaded panel on the right side of the layout. In this case, the flexbox container is the `Section` while the flexbox items are the `Articles`:

```html
<section id="panel">
  <article>1</article>
  <article>2</article>
  <article>3.14159265359</article>
</section>
```

This is how the preceding HTML displays without any flexbox CSS:

![Default Flex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827760-3ac0c365-f0ec-42db-b51d-b57106994bd1.png)

You create a flexbox container in your CSS file by using an appropriate CSS selector to select the element within the HTML you wish to make into a flexbox container. Then, you assign the `display` property for that element to `flex`. Here is an example:

```css
#panel {
  display: flex;
}
```

By default, the flexbox lays out items horizontally. Applying the `display` property of `flex` results in this display of the non-shaded areas:

![Default Flex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827833-ce42b9af-8ce7-4d9c-b8c4-8bc47d3b6087.png)

Flexbox provides many reasonable defaults so developers can avoid writing additional CSS. The important defaults applied to the preceding picture are the `flex-direction` and a property named `flex-grow`. The `flex-direction` CSS property defines the flexbox layout as either a **_row_** or a **_column_**.

You'll read about `flex-grow` later in this unit. For now, know the default is for the items to take up all the space available in the vertical direction, but only enough space to fit their content in the horizontal direction.

The default value for `flex-direction` is `row`, so you see a row of flexbox items in the previous example. To create a column of flexbox items, add the CSS property of `flex-direction` with the value of `column`:

```css
#panel {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

The non-shaded area on the right side of the layout is now a column of flexbox items:

![Default Flex Column](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827871-849f1c22-f2b7-4019-a84b-611fd0a16c51.png)

Notice that the vertical element items still take up the entire width because there's no `width` and `height` set on the items. By default, the `flex-grow` property, discussed soon, consumes all the space.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Width and height are set throughout remaining examples**
>
>In the remaining examples, each item has a width and height set for better visual reference.

# Sizing Flexbox Items

The browser carries out complex calculations for you when you use flexbox. The calculations consider the available space within the container and the amount of space required by each item within that container. The `flex-basis` property specifies the initial size of the flexbox item before the browser carries out these calculations. The `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` properties determine how to adjust each item to fit the space available.

You apply these CSS properties to the flexbox items, not the container. You can set these properties on the item elements either collectively or individually for each item. In the examples so far, `flex-basis` is automatically set to its default, `auto`, which uses the `width` and `height` of the flexbox item as the `basis`.

The `flex-basis` property may also be set to a value of `content`, which determines the size of the content within the item and uses that value as the `flex-basis`. You can also set`flex-basis` to a CSS length value, like `33%` or `200px`.

The following sample CSS and images apply to this HTML contained in the non-shaded area on the bottom-center of the layout:

```html
<section id="bottom-horizontal">
  <article id="A">A</article>
  <article id="B">B</article>
  <article id="C">C</article>
  <article id="D">D</article>
</section>
```

In the following code block, there is no `flex-basis` property specified in the CSS:

```css
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  /* No flex-basis specified */
}
```

The image below shows the result. Note the remaining space to the right of the `D` element:

![Flex Basis 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176831388-ad8e5704-0a0e-4d68-8b59-6da306a4e9d7.png)

In this code block, `flex-basis` is set to `50%` on the first item:

```css
#A {
  flex-basis: 50%;
}
```

This allows that item to take up half of the available space:

![Flex Basis 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176831442-a6db8ca9-67a5-46aa-8663-11f8b129eee1.png)

Notice that there's still space remaining to the right of the `D` element. This is because the combined width of all the items isn't enough to fill the space.

Finally, in this code block, `flex-basis` is set to `50%` for the first three items:

```css
#A, #B, #C {
  flex-basis: 50%;
}
```

Notice how the flexbox container doesn't expand to fit the three items:

![Flex Basis 3x50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176831481-2e514d39-73f5-4bb2-b25b-10b077e123f3.png)

There are multiple approaches to addressing this problem. The next lesson discusses one common approach.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: How flex grow calculations work**
>
>The calculations used by the browser are beyond the scope of this lesson. For more information, see [How Flex Grow Calculations Work](https://css-tricks.com/flex-grow-is-weird/) .

---

# Adjusting Item Width

In most of the previous examples, there has been some "available space" left to the right of the `D` element, after flexbox calculated the amount of space needed for each item. To take advantage of all of the space available within the container, you use the `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` CSS properties.

The default value for each property is zero and produces the output you've seen thus far. Setting `flex-grow` to `1` for each `article` results in a different output:

```html
<section id="bottom-horizontal">
  <article id="A">A</article>
  <article id="B">B</article>
  <article id="C">C</article>
  <article id="D">D</article>
</section>
```

```css
article {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

![Flex Grow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176831588-53ba82af-774d-4f24-9547-504533f05fbe.png)

The value for `flex-grow` is a **_relative_** amount. Flexbox uses this relative amount to calculate a ratio of how much of the **_available space_** to add to each item. Since all the items have the same value, they each get an equal share of the additional space.

Consider a design that requires the first and last items to "grow" from their original (`flex-basis`) widths twice as much as the second and third items grow. You can set `flex-grow` to `2` on the first and last items and `flex-grow` to `1` on the second and third to accomplish this goal:

```css
article:nth-child(1),
article:nth-child(4) {
  flex-grow: 2;
}
article:nth-child(2),
article:nth-child(3) {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

![Flex Grow Double](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176831630-4699ffaf-4263-47b4-b548-ae6a2964891e.png)

Notice that `A` and `D` aren't twice as wide as `B` and `C`. From their original widths, the first and last elements **_grew twice as much_** as the middle two. Flexbox first gave every element the amount of space it needed (`flex-basis`), and then gave twice as much of the remaining available space to the two end elements.

The `flex-shrink` property works in the opposite way. You remove space rather than add. This is important because it allows you to control the layout when the items overflow the container.

# Item Flow and Order

## Applying normal flow to flexbox

Responsive design requires layouts to change relative to the screen size of the device in use. Flexbox supports this concept naturally using the `flex-wrap` property with a value of `wrap`:

```css
article {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

![Flex Wrap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176833030-c5c93143-674b-4bab-b3a1-7c825f8a81ed.gif)

## Arranging items within a flexbox container using `order`

You may need to change the order of the items within a flexbox. By default, flexbox lays items out in the HTML source order. Traditionally, developers change the source order by moving content from one location to another in the HTML. Flexbox simplifies this through the use of the `order` property. The order property controls the order in which items appear in the flexbox container:

```css
#C {
  order: -1;
}
```

![Flex Order Negative](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176833057-03a4155f-08d5-4389-bfb1-b64129b4e562.png)

The `order` property takes a number as a value. Flexbox sorts items in a container by ascending order value and then by their source code order. Each item can have its own `order` value, and there can be duplicates.

In the case of duplicates, the process is to sort by `order` first and then sort by source order. As shown in the previous image, a negative value results in moving items earlier than the first item in the flow.

A positive number moves the item to the right relative to the first item, as shown below:

```css
#C {
  order: 3;
}
```

![Flex Order Positive](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176833071-625ff984-f40f-4841-97b7-47e87ba9780c.png)

# Aligning Item Content

The ability to **_align_** and **_justify_** content is where the value of flexbox shines. Flexbox considers content to be on two axes for arranging items inside a container.

To arrange items in the vertical axis, you'd use the `align-items` property. `justify-content` arranges items along the horizontal axis:

![Align Justify Start End](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176937586-0061bc83-83db-44a2-9cd0-af54eb7e0ec1.png)

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: `align-items` and `justify-content` depend on `flex-direction`**
>
>This lesson describes how to align content for a flexbox whose `flex-direction` is `row` (the default value). For a row-based flexbox, `justify-content` distributes space **_horizontally_**. The [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content) refers to this as the **_main axis_** for a row-based flexbox. `align-items` manipulates item alignment on the vertical axis. This is known as the **_cross axis_** in the documentation.
>
>The remainder of this lesson assumes the flexbox has `flex-direction: row` when describing the behavior of the alignment properties, but know that for a column-based flexbox, the keywords work on the opposite axes.

## Arranging flexbox items along the vertical axis

To arrange items along the vertical axis, you use `align-items`. The `align-items` CSS property has several settings.

---

### `align-items: flex-start | flex-end`

```css
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start; /* | flex-end */
}
```

![Align Start End](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176937634-65262439-eb14-4d05-80e4-b0f33d72e4a1.gif)

---

### `align-items: center`

```css
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```

![Align Center](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176937696-46a81e57-b6a2-4877-99f0-90a007e21fae.gif)

---

### `align-items: stretch`

```css
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  align-items: stretch;
}
```

![Align Stretch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176937745-2b2dd9e4-3079-425f-84fa-6f887c724f59.gif)

---

## Arranging flexbox items along the horizontal axis

To arrange items along the horizontal axis, you use `justify-content`. The `justify-content` CSS property takes several values.

---

### `justify-content: flex-start | flex-end`

```css
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-start; /* | flex-end */
}
```

![Justify Start End](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176937795-2a864873-37df-43ed-8b7a-eccdccd3fabd.gif)

---

### `justify-content: center`

```css
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

![Justify Center](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176937846-dbd4ffbf-51fb-4701-ae5f-5e10d96a2f0b.gif)

---

### `justify-content: stretch`

```css
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: stretch;
}
```

---

## Spacing flexbox items

To space items along the horizontal axis, you'd use `space-evenly`, `space-between` and `space-around`. These CSS properties provide spacing in various ways. Look at the following examples to see the subtle differences achieved by using each of these properties.

---

### `justify-content: space-evenly`

```css
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}
```

![Justify Start End](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176937938-bf68e7a9-b046-4872-8c63-5a079e3b0c64.gif)

---

### `justify-content: space-between`

```css
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

![Justify Space Between](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176937970-c27c00f4-daff-4b30-9fd0-8771c9d7506e.gif)

---

### `justify-content: space-around`

```css
#bottom-horizontal {

  justify-content: space-around;
}
```

# When to use Flexbox or Grid

Generally speaking, there are three main considerations when trying to determine which technology to use. While both CSS grid and flexbox appear to compete with each other, the use cases they support differ. Here are some questions to ask yourself:

**1. Is the layout two-dimensional or one-dimensional?**

CSS grid helps with two-dimensional layoutsâ€”meaning both rows and columnsâ€”while flexbox helps with one-dimensional layoutsâ€”**_either_** rows **_or_** columns. But what does this mean?

For any layout that has symmetry in both the vertical and horizontal orientations at the same time, grid is the best choice. One reason is that grid is more performant for this type of structure.

The strength of flexbox is in the ability to organize, align, and adjust related content. Specifically, when considering how information or components tell a story together as a component, flexbox is generally the answer.

**2. Is the design based upon content or structure?**

Think of a house blueprint. If your task is to build the house, then structure is important. An architect is responsible for the overall task of laying out the house and how the spaces relate to one another. An interior designer is responsible for focusing on each room of that house blueprint and thinking about how to arrange the furniture.

Solving problems with CSS means interpreting a user interface design that's much like that blueprint. If the task involves applying CSS to solve a page structure or layout problem, then grid is the go-to for solving this problem. This is often referred to as "outside in" or "layout first" design.

On the other hand, if the task involves placing, spacing, aligning, and adjusting related content together (furniture in a room) the go-to tool is likely to be flexbox. This is often referred to as "inside out" or "content first" design.

---

# When to Combine Flexbox and Grid

You can answer the questions from the previous section when considering those use cases. You don't always have to use grid and flexbox separately. They're often used together to solve problems related to their individual strengths.

The next series of images clarify these points.

**Grid is most appropriate for this design**

The orange boundary markers on this image show symmetry in both rows and columns. There is spacing between the rows and columns. These are strengths of the grid layout.

![Grid Layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176939128-899a4c84-175a-4b69-b793-7c8f5abcd8ad.png)

**Flexbox is most appropriate for the rows in this design**

The first thing to notice in this image is the lack of symmetry. This page is seemingly made up of three rows that each have their own individual layout problems to solve. Arranging related content is the strength of flexbox.

![Flex Overlay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176939178-83efca16-0d42-4461-8b3a-e0a05c8b270e.png)

**Flexbox insert**

This is a component containing related image, text, and actions. Since this is a part of a larger page and all the content is related, Flexbox is the ideal tool to use.

![Flex Insert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176939218-365fba93-c710-4e94-bdff-c8d545c73ad2.png)

**Using them together**

Consider the original layout offered at the beginning of this lesson. After reading this chapter, you can see that there are flexbox containers placed inside what was just described as a perfect candidate for a grid layout.

It's common to see flexbox inside a grid. While you can use a grid within a flexbox, it isn't often done.

## **CSS Flexbox 6**

**Given the following HTML and CSS, which CSS declaration allows the second and fourth boxes to fill twice the available space as the other boxes if used with the `.box:nth-child(2), .box:nth-child(4)` selector?**

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176939629-4092936f-4498-4707-a088-2a2b2d24fc19.png)

```html
<section>
    <div class="box" id="A">1</div>
    <div class="box" id="B">2</div>
    <div class="box" id="C">3</div>
    <div class="box" id="D">4</div>
</section>
```

```css
.box {
     padding: 40px;
     background-color: #00AFEF;
     color: #fff;
     text-align: center;
     flex-grow: 1;
}
```

â—‹ `flex-shrink: 2`

â—‹ `flex-grow: 50%`

â—‹ `flex-basis: 200%`

â—‰ `flex-grow: 2`

**Explanation:** `flex-grow` with a value of `2` allows the flex items to use twice as much of the available space as the boxes with `flex-grow: 1`.


## **CSS Flexbox 7**

**Select the true statements about grid and flexbox.**

	Select all correct options

â–  Grid and flexbox have their own individual strengths and can be used together in the same layout.

â–  Grid is for building the layout of the page. Flexbox is for positioning elements relative to each other.

â–¡ Grid and flexbox solve the same problems and should never be used together.

â–  Grid is used for two-dimensional layouts, and flexbox is used for one-dimensional layouts.

â–¡ Flexbox containers only appear as one row of content. Anything else is grid.

**Explanation:** A common approach is to layout the major page areas with grid and then arrange elements within those areas with flexbox.
