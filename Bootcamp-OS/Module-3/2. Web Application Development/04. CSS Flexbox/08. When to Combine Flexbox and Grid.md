# When to Combine Flexbox and Grid

You can answer the questions from the previous section when considering those use cases. You don't always have to use grid and flexbox separately. They're often used together to solve problems related to their individual strengths.

The next series of images clarify these points.

**Grid is most appropriate for this design**

The orange boundary markers on this image show symmetry in both rows and columns. There is spacing between the rows and columns. These are strengths of the grid layout.

**Flexbox is most appropriate for the rows in this design**

The first thing to notice in this image is the lack of symmetry. This page is seemingly made up of three rows that each have their own individual layout problems to solve. Arranging related content is the strength of flexbox.

**Flexbox insert**

This is a component containing related image, text, and actions. Since this is a part of a larger page and all the content is related, Flexbox is the ideal tool to use.

**Using them together**

Consider the original layout offered at the beginning of this lesson. After reading this chapter, you can see that there are flexbox containers placed inside what was just described as a perfect candidate for a grid layout.

It's common to see flexbox inside a grid. While you can use a grid within a flexbox, it isn't often done.
