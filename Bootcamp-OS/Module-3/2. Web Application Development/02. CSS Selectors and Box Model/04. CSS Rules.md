# CSS Rules

Along with the selector, a CSS rule consists of at least one property and value. For instance, if you wanted to change the background color of all `div`s to red, you could write a rule like this:

```css
div {
    background-color: red;
}
```

In this example, `background-color` is the property, and `red` is the value that's being set to that property. Note that the property and value are separated by a colon `:` and the CSS rule has a semi-colon `;` at the end. The semi-colons are important when you have multiple property-value pairs.

If you wanted to also style those `div`s to be only 500 pixels wide, the CSS rule would look like this:

```css
div {
    background-color: red;
    width: 500px;
}
```

You can find all the CSS properties that can be changed on MDN's [CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) page.
