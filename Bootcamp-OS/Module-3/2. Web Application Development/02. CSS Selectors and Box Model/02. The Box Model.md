# The Box Model

By default, elements appear on a webpage in the same order as they appear in the source code. This is called **normal flow**.

The following diagram shows an example of how normal flow works. The block elements render in the order they're written in the HTML:

When it comes to positioning elements, you can think of every element as a rectangular box. Some may have rounded corners or there may be circular images, but the browser treats everything as a rectangular box. This is what's known as the **box model**.

There are three types of "boxes" with different layout behaviors: `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`. It's important to understand the default layout behavior of these boxes and how they interact.

## `block`

A `block` element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available, meaning that it stretches out to the left and right as far as it can. If it's contained inside another element, it only takes up the width of that element, not the entire page. By default, `block` elements use as much height as the content needs, but it's possible to change the height and width.

Examples of block level elements include:

-   `<div>`
-   `<h1>` - `<h6>`
-   `<p>`
-   `<form>`
-   `<header>`
-   `<footer>`
-   `<section>`

## `inline`

An `inline` element doesn't start on a new line and only takes up as much height and width as necessary. It stays **_inline_** to the text that it's contained in. You can't set the height and width of an `inline` element.

Examples of inline elements include:

-   `<span>`
-   `<a>`
-   `<img>`
-   `<em>`
-   `<strong>`

## `inline-block`

An `inline-block` element is very similar to `inline`, but you **_can_** set the height and width of it. This can be useful if you want to change the size of certain elements but don't want them to start on a new line.

Examples of inline-block elements include:

-   `<select>`
-   `<button>`

## Example of elements together

If the following HTML was rendered in a browser:

```html
<h1>Header Level 1</h1>
<p>This is some text that we are putting on the page. It has some <em>inline</em> elements as well.

This isn't actually another paragraph. Text will eventually wrap to the next line, but you can't put line breaks by
pressing Enter.</p>
<p>But this is another paragraph. It has a <a href="page.html">link to another page</a> within it. There's a button too! <button>Click Here</button></p>

<div>
This div is a block element but contains another <h2>block element</h2> that ends up on its own line.
</div>
```

It would look like this:

The elements outlined in green are `block` elements, those outlined in blue are `inline` elements, and those outlined in red are `inline-block` elements.

In this example, the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<div>` and `<p>` elements get their own "line" while the `<em>`, `<a>`, and `<button>` elements stay inline with the text. Notice how the `<button>` is larger because it's an `inline-block`, and as a result, causes the height of the containing `<p>` to grow as well.

Knowing this information, you can predict how a webpage will flow as you're writing the code.

## Spacing

Along with height and width, elements also have some default properties that affect their size such as **margin**, **padding**, and **border**:

-   Padding is the space **_inside an element_**. It's the space between the element's content and border.
-   Border is the **_edge of an element_**. An element may not have a visible border, but you can add one with CSS.
-   Margin is the space **_outside an element_**. It doesn't affect the visible size of the box, but it does affect how other content gets rendered around it.

The content, padding, border, and margin are used to calculate the amount of space that an element takes up.

Below is a diagram of the box model as it relates to `margin`, `padding`, and `border`:
