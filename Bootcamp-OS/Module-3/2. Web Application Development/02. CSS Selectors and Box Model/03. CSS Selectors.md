# CSS Selectors

CSS is used to change the default styles of HTML elements in the browser. You can change element colors, borders, widths, heights, fonts, and display styles. To define these new rules, you first need to "select" the elements that you want to change.

## Basic selectors

A **selector** selects the element or elements that you want to style on the page. There are many ways to write selectors based on how broad or specific you want to be.

### Element selector

The element, or type, selector selects all HTML elements of a certain type. If you want to style all `<div>` elements, the CSS selector is `div`:

```css
div {
    ...
}
```

### Class selector

If you only want to style some elements but not others of the same type, you can apply a `class` attribute to the HTML elements, and write your CSS selector to apply to that `class`:

```html
<div class="notice"></div>
<span class="notice"></span>
```

```css
.notice {
    ...
}
```

Note how the selector starts with a `.`. This is how you denote a `class` in CSS.

### ID selector

If you want to apply your style to only one element, you can apply an `id` attribute to the HTML element, and write your CSS selector to apply to that `id`:

```html
<div id="info"></div>
```

```css
#info {
    ...
}
```

Note how the selector starts with a `#`. This is how you denote a `id` in CSS.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: IDs should be unique**
>
>In your HTML document, no two elements should have the same ID. IDs are meant to be unique in HTML. There's nothing that strictly enforces this, but certain things won't work if you reuse an ID anywhere.

## Advanced selectors

Now that you've seen basic selectors, there are a few more "advanced" selectors to know. These may not be used as much as the other selector types, but you might find yourself needing one of these selectors or come across it in an existing project.

### Universal selector

The universal selector selects **_every_** element on a page. This could be useful in situations where you want to set some "default" values for the page, like font size and color. The universal selector is a single `*`:

```css
* {
    ...
}
```

### Attribute selector

The attribute selector selects elements that have the defined attribute, and optionally attribute value too. You could think of this as a longhand version of the `class` and `id` selectors, but for any attribute that you have on an element. If the attribute value isn't provided, the selector matches as long as an attribute exists. The attribute selector uses `[]` to denote the attribute:

```css
input[type] {
    ...
}
input[type=text] {
    ...
}
```

```html
<input type="button" value="This only matches the first selector" />
<input type="text" value="This matches both selectors" />
```

There are ways to write selectors that match if the attribute value starts with, ends with, or contains a value. You can read more about attribute selectors on the [MDN page for Attribute Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) .

### Pseudo-class selector

A pseudo-class defines a special state of an element based on user interaction or its location. A pseudo-class begins with a colon `:`. This example applies the CSS rule when the user hovers the mouse over any `<a>` element:

```css
a:hover {
    ...
}
```

Other pseudo-classes include:

-   `:focus` for when the user interacts with an `input` element, like typing, or is ready to type in a text box.
-   `:active` to select the element the user is actively clicking on; typically used for `a` elements, but can be applied to any type.
-   `:first-child` and `:last-child` selects every element that's the first or last child of its parent.
-   `:enabled` and `:disabled` matches every enabled or disabled element; mostly used on `input` elements in a form.

There are many more pseudo-classes. These are some of the more common ones. You can read more about them at the [MDN page for Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) .

## Combinators

Another powerful feature of CSS selectors is that you can combine them to specify the elements you want from the page. There are several combinators that you can use to narrow down your selection.

### Combo combinator

You can combine selectors into very specific selections by combining them:

```css
button[type=submit].danger {
    ...
}
```

This code example uses an element selector, an attribute selector, and a class selector to apply the rule to any `button` element that has an attribute of `type` equal to `submit` that also has a class of `danger`. There can be no spaces between any of these parts if you want them all to apply to the same element.

### Multiple combinator

You can have a set of styles apply to different elements by separating those elements with a comma. The following style applies to all `button`s **_and_** all checkboxes **_and_** all `select` elements:

```css
button, input[type=checkbox], select {
    ...
}
```

See the following diagram for another example and how the elements are selected in the document tree:

### Descendant combinator

Descendant combinators select all the elements that are inside another element. The following rule applies to any `p` element that's anywhere within a `div` element that has a class of `aside`:

```css
div.aside p {
    ...
}
```

For example, the styles apply to the following `p` elements:

```html
<div class="aside">
    <p>Styles will apply to this paragraph</p>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Styles will apply to this paragraph also because it is still inside the div.aside</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

See the following diagram for another example and how the elements are selected in the document tree:

### Child combinator

Child combinators select all the elements that are **_direct children_** of another element. The following rule applies to any `p` element that's directly under a `div` element that has a class of `aside`:

```css
div.aside > p {
    ...
}
```

For example, the styles apply to only the first `p` element:

```html
<div class="aside">
    <p>Styles will apply to this paragraph</p>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Styles will *NOT* apply to this paragraph because it is not a direct child of div.aside</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

See the following diagram for another example and how the elements are selected in the document tree:
