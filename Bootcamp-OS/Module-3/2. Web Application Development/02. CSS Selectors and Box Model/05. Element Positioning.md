# Element positioning

By default, all elements are rendered in the flow of the page using the box model rules you saw earlier. However, there are ways to dynamically position any element using CSS. You can do this with the `position` property.

## `static` positioning

Many CSS properties have a default value, and for `position` that default value is `static`. Setting the `position` value to `static` positions the element according to the normal flow of the document. The browser reacts to a user scrolling the page as if the element is stuck, statically, to the page. If you don't set a position for an element, this is the position value that it has.

## `relative` positioning

Setting the `position` value to `relative` offsets the element from its normal location. With an element set to `relative`, you can then set `top`, `bottom`, `right`, or `left` to move the element. Even though the element is moved, the browser still keeps all other elements in the same position as if it was still there, essentially reserving its space. This can create a blank space on the page where the element would have been or may result in overlapping elements.

### Example

This CSS rule shifts the element 40 pixels **_down_** and 75 pixels to the **_right_**:

```css
.inside-box {
    position: relative;
    top: 40px;
    left: 75px;
}
```

The `top` property indicates how far to move it from its original top coordinateâ€”effectively moving it downâ€”and `left` indicates how far to move it from its original left coordinateâ€”effectively moving it to the right. In other words, you're positioning it **relative** to where it would have been without the CSS rule, as the following image shows:

## `fixed` positioning

Setting the `position` to `fixed` lets you take the element out of the normal flow and place it wherever you want in the browser windowâ€”otherwise known as the **viewport**. Once you declare an element to have `position: fixed`, you can set the `top`, `bottom`, `right`, or `left` properties to define where in the viewport you want it to be displayed.

Unlike `relative`, `top` defines how far from the top edge of the viewport you want the element set, and `left` defines how from the left edge of the viewport you want it displayed. Similarly, `bottom` and `right` position the element that many pixels from the bottom and right edges of the viewport.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Remember it's fixed to the window, not the page**
>
>Even when a user scrolls through the page, the element still stays in the same place. Remember that `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` refer to the browser window, not the page itself. Not setting a location causes the element to be `fixed` to wherever it normally shows up on the page.

### Example

This CSS rule sets the element to a fixed position 20 pixels from the top and 70 pixels from the left of the viewport:

```css
.inside-box {
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    left: 70px;
}
```

Note how the green box doesn't move as the browser window is scrolled in the following gif:

## `absolute` positioning

Setting the `position` value to `absolute` lets you take the element out of the normal flow and place it wherever you want within the parent element, similar to how `fixed` positions the element within the viewport.

Like `fixed`, when you declare an element to have `position: absolute`, you can set the `top`, `bottom`, `right`, or `left` properties to define where in the parent element you want it set. These four properties also define how far from those edges of the parent that the element is set.

Elements positioned with `absolute` are taken out of the normal flow. The browser doesn't reserve a blank spot for this element and as far as the other elements are concerned, it's as if it was never on the page.

If you imagine the page being like a piece of paper under a sheet of glass, `absolute` sticks the element to the paper while `fixed` sticks the element to the glass.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Parent element must be positioned too**
>
>When using `position: absolute`, the parent element must also be "positioned", which means `position` must be set to any value **except** `static`. If the parent element isn't positioned, the styled element uses the document body as its parent element.

### Example

```css
.outside-box {
    position: relative;
}
.inside-box {
    position: absolute;
    right: 80px;
    bottom: 20px;
}
```
