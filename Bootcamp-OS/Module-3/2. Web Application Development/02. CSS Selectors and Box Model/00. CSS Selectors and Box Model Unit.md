# Introduction

You've learned that HTML is used for content writing and defining document structure, and that CSS defines styles that alter an HTML element's default appearance.

You'll now learn about the default layout for HTML elements, how to change that layout, and how to apply styles to a narrower selection of elements.

# The Box Model

By default, elements appear on a webpage in the same order as they appear in the source code. This is called **normal flow**.

The following diagram shows an example of how normal flow works. The block elements render in the order they're written in the HTML:

![Normal Flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176085598-a31bec6b-94d5-48a7-af82-dc7f0513a016.png)

When it comes to positioning elements, you can think of every element as a rectangular box. Some may have rounded corners or there may be circular images, but the browser treats everything as a rectangular box. This is what's known as the **box model**.

There are three types of "boxes" with different layout behaviors: `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`. It's important to understand the default layout behavior of these boxes and how they interact.

## `block`

A `block` element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available, meaning that it stretches out to the left and right as far as it can. If it's contained inside another element, it only takes up the width of that element, not the entire page. By default, `block` elements use as much height as the content needs, but it's possible to change the height and width.

Examples of block level elements include:

-   `<div>`
-   `<h1>` - `<h6>`
-   `<p>`
-   `<form>`
-   `<header>`
-   `<footer>`
-   `<section>`

## `inline`

An `inline` element doesn't start on a new line and only takes up as much height and width as necessary. It stays **_inline_** to the text that it's contained in. You can't set the height and width of an `inline` element.

Examples of inline elements include:

-   `<span>`
-   `<a>`
-   `<img>`
-   `<em>`
-   `<strong>`

## `inline-block`

An `inline-block` element is very similar to `inline`, but you **_can_** set the height and width of it. This can be useful if you want to change the size of certain elements but don't want them to start on a new line.

Examples of inline-block elements include:

-   `<select>`
-   `<button>`

## Example of elements together

If the following HTML was rendered in a browser:

```html
<h1>Header Level 1</h1>
<p>This is some text that we are putting on the page. It has some <em>inline</em> elements as well.

This isn't actually another paragraph. Text will eventually wrap to the next line, but you can't put line breaks by
pressing Enter.</p>
<p>But this is another paragraph. It has a <a href="page.html">link to another page</a> within it. There's a button too! <button>Click Here</button></p>

<div>
This div is a block element but contains another <h2>block element</h2> that ends up on its own line.
</div>
```

It would look like this:

![Box Model Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176085662-24d57a96-bc67-4356-a225-50b4c1a55504.png)

The elements outlined in green are `block` elements, those outlined in blue are `inline` elements, and those outlined in red are `inline-block` elements.

In this example, the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<div>` and `<p>` elements get their own "line" while the `<em>`, `<a>`, and `<button>` elements stay inline with the text. Notice how the `<button>` is larger because it's an `inline-block`, and as a result, causes the height of the containing `<p>` to grow as well.

Knowing this information, you can predict how a webpage will flow as you're writing the code.

## Spacing

Along with height and width, elements also have some default properties that affect their size such as **margin**, **padding**, and **border**:

-   Padding is the space **_inside an element_**. It's the space between the element's content and border.
-   Border is the **_edge of an element_**. An element may not have a visible border, but you can add one with CSS.
-   Margin is the space **_outside an element_**. It doesn't affect the visible size of the box, but it does affect how other content gets rendered around it.

The content, padding, border, and margin are used to calculate the amount of space that an element takes up.

Below is a diagram of the box model as it relates to `margin`, `padding`, and `border`:

![Box Model - Margin, Padding, and Border](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176085703-422aae72-a94b-4d41-9447-097f2cfe3791.png)

# CSS Selectors

CSS is used to change the default styles of HTML elements in the browser. You can change element colors, borders, widths, heights, fonts, and display styles. To define these new rules, you first need to "select" the elements that you want to change.

## Basic selectors

A **selector** selects the element or elements that you want to style on the page. There are many ways to write selectors based on how broad or specific you want to be.

### Element selector

The element, or type, selector selects all HTML elements of a certain type. If you want to style all `<div>` elements, the CSS selector is `div`:

```css
div {
    ...
}
```

### Class selector

If you only want to style some elements but not others of the same type, you can apply a `class` attribute to the HTML elements, and write your CSS selector to apply to that `class`:

```html
<div class="notice"></div>
<span class="notice"></span>
```

```css
.notice {
    ...
}
```

Note how the selector starts with a `.`. This is how you denote a `class` in CSS.

### ID selector

If you want to apply your style to only one element, you can apply an `id` attribute to the HTML element, and write your CSS selector to apply to that `id`:

```html
<div id="info"></div>
```

```css
#info {
    ...
}
```

Note how the selector starts with a `#`. This is how you denote a `id` in CSS.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: IDs should be unique**
>
>In your HTML document, no two elements should have the same ID. IDs are meant to be unique in HTML. There's nothing that strictly enforces this, but certain things won't work if you reuse an ID anywhere.

## Advanced selectors

Now that you've seen basic selectors, there are a few more "advanced" selectors to know. These may not be used as much as the other selector types, but you might find yourself needing one of these selectors or come across it in an existing project.

### Universal selector

The universal selector selects **_every_** element on a page. This could be useful in situations where you want to set some "default" values for the page, like font size and color. The universal selector is a single `*`:

```css
* {
    ...
}
```

### Attribute selector

The attribute selector selects elements that have the defined attribute, and optionally attribute value too. You could think of this as a longhand version of the `class` and `id` selectors, but for any attribute that you have on an element. If the attribute value isn't provided, the selector matches as long as an attribute exists. The attribute selector uses `[]` to denote the attribute:

```css
input[type] {
    ...
}
input[type=text] {
    ...
}
```

```html
<input type="button" value="This only matches the first selector" />
<input type="text" value="This matches both selectors" />
```

There are ways to write selectors that match if the attribute value starts with, ends with, or contains a value. You can read more about attribute selectors on the [MDN page for Attribute Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) .

### Pseudo-class selector

A pseudo-class defines a special state of an element based on user interaction or its location. A pseudo-class begins with a colon `:`. This example applies the CSS rule when the user hovers the mouse over any `<a>` element:

```css
a:hover {
    ...
}
```

Other pseudo-classes include:

-   `:focus` for when the user interacts with an `input` element, like typing, or is ready to type in a text box.
-   `:active` to select the element the user is actively clicking on; typically used for `a` elements, but can be applied to any type.
-   `:first-child` and `:last-child` selects every element that's the first or last child of its parent.
-   `:enabled` and `:disabled` matches every enabled or disabled element; mostly used on `input` elements in a form.

There are many more pseudo-classes. These are some of the more common ones. You can read more about them at the [MDN page for Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) .

## Combinators

Another powerful feature of CSS selectors is that you can combine them to specify the elements you want from the page. There are several combinators that you can use to narrow down your selection.

### Combo combinator

You can combine selectors into very specific selections by combining them:

```css
button[type=submit].danger {
    ...
}
```

This code example uses an element selector, an attribute selector, and a class selector to apply the rule to any `button` element that has an attribute of `type` equal to `submit` that also has a class of `danger`. There can be no spaces between any of these parts if you want them all to apply to the same element.

### Multiple combinator

You can have a set of styles apply to different elements by separating those elements with a comma. The following style applies to all `button`s **_and_** all checkboxes **_and_** all `select` elements:

```css
button, input[type=checkbox], select {
    ...
}
```

See the following diagram for another example and how the elements are selected in the document tree:

![Multiple Combinator Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176085995-844f8baa-4691-4321-b073-b1f7236ac66a.png)

### Descendant combinator

Descendant combinators select all the elements that are inside another element. The following rule applies to any `p` element that's anywhere within a `div` element that has a class of `aside`:

```css
div.aside p {
    ...
}
```

For example, the styles apply to the following `p` elements:

```html
<div class="aside">
    <p>Styles will apply to this paragraph</p>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Styles will apply to this paragraph also because it is still inside the div.aside</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

See the following diagram for another example and how the elements are selected in the document tree:

![Descendant Combinator Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176086037-c66449d0-97bb-49fe-a382-f0d8a5d6cb86.png)

### Child combinator

Child combinators select all the elements that are **_direct children_** of another element. The following rule applies to any `p` element that's directly under a `div` element that has a class of `aside`:

```css
div.aside > p {
    ...
}
```

For example, the styles apply to only the first `p` element:

```html
<div class="aside">
    <p>Styles will apply to this paragraph</p>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Styles will *NOT* apply to this paragraph because it is not a direct child of div.aside</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

See the following diagram for another example and how the elements are selected in the document tree:

![Child Combinator Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176086062-0da2c843-b83d-4667-a4f9-dd6e35e595d0.png)

# CSS Rules

Along with the selector, a CSS rule consists of at least one property and value. For instance, if you wanted to change the background color of all `div`s to red, you could write a rule like this:

```css
div {
    background-color: red;
}
```

In this example, `background-color` is the property, and `red` is the value that's being set to that property. Note that the property and value are separated by a colon `:` and the CSS rule has a semi-colon `;` at the end. The semi-colons are important when you have multiple property-value pairs.

If you wanted to also style those `div`s to be only 500 pixels wide, the CSS rule would look like this:

```css
div {
    background-color: red;
    width: 500px;
}
```

You can find all the CSS properties that can be changed on MDN's [CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) page.

# Element positioning

By default, all elements are rendered in the flow of the page using the box model rules you saw earlier. However, there are ways to dynamically position any element using CSS. You can do this with the `position` property.

## `static` positioning

Many CSS properties have a default value, and for `position` that default value is `static`. Setting the `position` value to `static` positions the element according to the normal flow of the document. The browser reacts to a user scrolling the page as if the element is stuck, statically, to the page. If you don't set a position for an element, this is the position value that it has.

## `relative` positioning

Setting the `position` value to `relative` offsets the element from its normal location. With an element set to `relative`, you can then set `top`, `bottom`, `right`, or `left` to move the element. Even though the element is moved, the browser still keeps all other elements in the same position as if it was still there, essentially reserving its space. This can create a blank space on the page where the element would have been or may result in overlapping elements.

### Example

This CSS rule shifts the element 40 pixels **_down_** and 75 pixels to the **_right_**:

```css
.inside-box {
    position: relative;
    top: 40px;
    left: 75px;
}
```

The `top` property indicates how far to move it from its original top coordinateâ€”effectively moving it downâ€”and `left` indicates how far to move it from its original left coordinateâ€”effectively moving it to the right. In other words, you're positioning it **relative** to where it would have been without the CSS rule, as the following image shows:

![position:relative example](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/0178890f4a5baa275f18781d8990e371.png)

## `fixed` positioning

Setting the `position` to `fixed` lets you take the element out of the normal flow and place it wherever you want in the browser windowâ€”otherwise known as the **viewport**. Once you declare an element to have `position: fixed`, you can set the `top`, `bottom`, `right`, or `left` properties to define where in the viewport you want it to be displayed.

Unlike `relative`, `top` defines how far from the top edge of the viewport you want the element set, and `left` defines how from the left edge of the viewport you want it displayed. Similarly, `bottom` and `right` position the element that many pixels from the bottom and right edges of the viewport.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Remember it's fixed to the window, not the page**
>
>Even when a user scrolls through the page, the element still stays in the same place. Remember that `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` refer to the browser window, not the page itself. Not setting a location causes the element to be `fixed` to wherever it normally shows up on the page.

### Example

This CSS rule sets the element to a fixed position 20 pixels from the top and 70 pixels from the left of the viewport:

```css
.inside-box {
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    left: 70px;
}
```

Note how the green box doesn't move as the browser window is scrolled in the following gif:

![position:fixed example](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/a073c29c044ce921dd2dfd907bd9dd51.gif)

## `absolute` positioning

Setting the `position` value to `absolute` lets you take the element out of the normal flow and place it wherever you want within the parent element, similar to how `fixed` positions the element within the viewport.

Like `fixed`, when you declare an element to have `position: absolute`, you can set the `top`, `bottom`, `right`, or `left` properties to define where in the parent element you want it set. These four properties also define how far from those edges of the parent that the element is set.

Elements positioned with `absolute` are taken out of the normal flow. The browser doesn't reserve a blank spot for this element and as far as the other elements are concerned, it's as if it was never on the page.

If you imagine the page being like a piece of paper under a sheet of glass, `absolute` sticks the element to the paper while `fixed` sticks the element to the glass.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Parent element must be positioned too**
>
>When using `position: absolute`, the parent element must also be "positioned", which means `position` must be set to any value **except** `static`. If the parent element isn't positioned, the styled element uses the document body as its parent element.

### Example

```css
.outside-box {
    position: relative;
}
.inside-box {
    position: absolute;
    right: 80px;
    bottom: 20px;
}
```

![position:absolute example](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/585ae379e9b2671eeb70de2bfba9ca1a.png)

# Units of Measurement

Every CSS declaration includes a property-value pair. Depending on the property, the value may require a unit of measurement. You saw these earlier in this unit with values like `20px`. `px` stands for "pixel" and represents one device pixel or dot on a screen. There are many units of measurement that are used for various CSS properties, but this section covers the most frequently used ones.

When including a length value, the unit identifier is required and is case insensitive. It must come immediately after the numeric part of the value, with no space in between. If the length is zero, the unit identifier isn't required:

```css
header {
  width: 600px;
}
.card {
  width: 10em;
  margin: 0; /* no unit needed when value is 0 */
}
```

There are two types of lengths in CSS: absolute and relative.

## Absolute units

Absolute units are fixed to a physical length, aren't relative to anything else, and are generally considered to always be the same size. The following example has a width set in pixels. As an absolute unit, this width remains the same no matter what else changes:

```css
container {
  width: 800px;
}
```

## Relative units

Relative units are relative to something else, perhaps the parent element, the root element, or size of the viewport. The benefit of using relative units over absolute is that your design can scale when your page does.

### `em` units

`em` is relative to the font size of the parent element. In the following example, there is an element with the class of `card` that defines a `font-size` of `10px`. Inside that element, there is a `<div>` with a class of `content`. Content defines a width of `20em` which is 20 times `.card`'s font size (10px) for a total width of `200px`:

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="content">
    Hello, Card...
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.card {
  font-size: 10px;
}
.card .content {
  width: 20em;
}
```

### `rem` units

`rem` stands for "root em." `rem` is relative to the font size of the root elementâ€”usually the `<html>` element. This typically defaults to `16px` by the browser but may be overridden in your style sheet.

You can use numbers in front of these units to multiply the length. If you used `2rem` as a CSS value, that would be twice the font size of the root element which, if not changed from the default, would be 32 pixels (2 times 16 = 32):

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 2rem; /* using default of 16px this would be 32px */
}
```

### Percentage %

Another type of relative length is a percentage value like `25%`. A percentage value is relative to the same measurement of the parent element. Many CSS properties can use percentage values, such as `width`, `height`, `margin`, and `padding`.

For example, if you specified `width: 50%`, that element would be half as wide as its parent element:

```html
<div class="container">
  <header></header>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  width: 800px;
}
header {
  width: 50%; /* 50% of 800px is 400px */
}
```

---

# Cascading and Specificity

When setting up CSS rules for elements, it's important to understand that if multiple CSS rules apply to a single element, the browser has special rules to figure out which styles must be applied. These special rules are called **specificity**.

The first thing to know is that the browser loads rules in the order that it sees them. This means that a rule that's loaded last takes precedence over a rule that's loaded earlier. The later styles override the earlier styles. This is called [cascading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade) .

But the selectors used in the rules can also matter. The more specific a rule is, the higher priority it has over other rules, no matter where or when they were defined. Each selector has a priority assigned to it, and they are listed in the order of least specific to most specific:

1.  **Type** selectors are the least specific
2.  **Class** selectors, attribute selectors and pseudo-classes
3.  **ID** selectors are the most specific

So, if you write a CSS rule and it doesn't apply the way you expected it to, check to make sure you don't have a more specific rule written elsewhere that overrides it. To do this, you can check your browser's development tools, which show you all the applied and overridden rules for any element that you select.

You can read more about specificity on the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) .
