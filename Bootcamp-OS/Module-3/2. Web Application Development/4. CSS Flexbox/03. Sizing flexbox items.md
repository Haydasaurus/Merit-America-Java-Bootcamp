# Sizing flexbox items

The browser carries out complex calculations for you when you use flexbox. The calculations consider the available space within the container and the amount of space required by each item within that container. The `flex-basis` property specifies the initial size of the flexbox item before the browser carries out these calculations. The `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` properties determine how to adjust each item to fit the space available.

You apply these CSS properties to the flexbox items, not the container. You can set these properties on the item elements either collectively or individually for each item. In the examples so far, `flex-basis` is automatically set to its default, `auto`, which uses the `width` and `height` of the flexbox item as the `basis`.

The `flex-basis` property may also be set to a value of `content`, which determines the size of the content within the item and uses that value as the `flex-basis`. You can also set`flex-basis` to a CSS length value, like `33%` or `200px`.

The following sample CSS and images apply to this HTML contained in the non-shaded area on the bottom-center of the layout:

```html
<section id="bottom-horizontal">
  <article id="A">A</article>
  <article id="B">B</article>
  <article id="C">C</article>
  <article id="D">D</article>
</section>
```

In the following code block, there is no `flex-basis` property specified in the CSS:

```css
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  /* No flex-basis specified */
}
```

The image below shows the result. Note the remaining space to the right of the `D` element:

![Flex Basis 50](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/5aca1b0c7e0d46dda49f3433ed17c5e6.png)

In this code block, `flex-basis` is set to `50%` on the first item:

```css
#A {
  flex-basis: 50%;
}
```

This allows that item to take up half of the available space:

![Flex Basis 50](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/b211a2cd1a9c62c02a17c611926a293e.png)

Notice that there's still space remaining to the right of the `D` element. This is because the combined width of all the items isn't enough to fill the space.

Finally, in this code block, `flex-basis` is set to `50%` for the first three items:

```css
#A, #B, #C {
  flex-basis: 50%;
}
```

Notice how the flexbox container doesn't expand to fit the three items:

![Flex Basis 3x50](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/f82589a65c6f571fb3ea902a7157aa74.png)

There are multiple approaches to addressing this problem. The next lesson discusses one common approach.
