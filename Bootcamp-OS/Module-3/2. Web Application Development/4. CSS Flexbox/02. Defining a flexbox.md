# Defining a flexbox

Imagine that you have this traditional page layout, and you're asked to place items into the non-shaded areas. Those non-shaded areas become **_flexbox containers_**. The child elements within the **_flexbox container_** are **_flexbox items_**.

>ðŸ›ˆ Note: Flexbox is intended for sections of pages
>
Typically, you don't use flexbox to layout an entire page, but to layout a group of like elements in one or more sections of the page.

For example, you might use the following HTML for the non-shaded panel on the right side of the layout. In this case, the flexbox container is the `Section` while the flexbox items are the `Articles`:

```html
<section id="panel">
  <article>1</article>
  <article>2</article>
  <article>3.14159265359</article>
</section>
```

This is how the preceding HTML displays without any flexbox CSS:

You create a flexbox container in your CSS file by using an appropriate CSS selector to select the element within the HTML you wish to make into a flexbox container. Then, you assign the `display` property for that element to `flex`. Here is an example:

```css
#panel {
  display: flex;
}
```

By default, the flexbox lays out items horizontally. Applying the `display` property of `flex` results in this display of the non-shaded areas:

Flexbox provides many reasonable defaults so developers can avoid writing additional CSS. The important defaults applied to the preceding picture are the `flex-direction` and a property named `flex-grow`. The `flex-direction` CSS property defines the flexbox layout as either a **_row_** or a **_column_**.

You'll read about `flex-grow` later in this unit. For now, know the default is for the items to take up all the space available in the vertical direction, but only enough space to fit their content in the horizontal direction.

The default value for `flex-direction` is `row`, so you see a row of flexbox items in the previous example. To create a column of flexbox items, add the CSS property of `flex-direction` with the value of `column`:

```css
#panel {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

The non-shaded area on the right side of the layout is now a column of flexbox items:

Notice that the vertical element items still take up the entire width because there's no `width` and `height` set on the items. By default, the `flex-grow` property, discussed soon, consumes all the space.
