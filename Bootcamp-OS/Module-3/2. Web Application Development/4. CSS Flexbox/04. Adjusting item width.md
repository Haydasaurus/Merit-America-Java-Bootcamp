# Adjusting Item Width

In most of the previous examples, there has been some "available space" left to the right of the `D` element, after flexbox calculated the amount of space needed for each item. To take advantage of all of the space available within the container, you use the `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` CSS properties.

The default value for each property is zero and produces the output you've seen thus far. Setting `flex-grow` to `1` for each `article` results in a different output:

```html
<section id="bottom-horizontal">
  <article id="A">A</article>
  <article id="B">B</article>
  <article id="C">C</article>
  <article id="D">D</article>
</section>
```

```css
article {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

The value for `flex-grow` is a **_relative_** amount. Flexbox uses this relative amount to calculate a ratio of how much of the **_available space_** to add to each item. Since all the items have the same value, they each get an equal share of the additional space.

Consider a design that requires the first and last items to "grow" from their original (`flex-basis`) widths twice as much as the second and third items grow. You can set `flex-grow` to `2` on the first and last items and `flex-grow` to `1` on the second and third to accomplish this goal:

```css
article:nth-child(1),
article:nth-child(4) {
  flex-grow: 2;
}
article:nth-child(2),
article:nth-child(3) {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

Notice that `A` and `D` aren't twice as wide as `B` and `C`. From their original widths, the first and last elements **_grew twice as much_** as the middle two. Flexbox first gave every element the amount of space it needed (`flex-basis`), and then gave twice as much of the remaining available space to the two end elements.

The `flex-shrink` property works in the opposite way. You remove space rather than add. This is important because it allows you to control the layout when the items overflow the container.
