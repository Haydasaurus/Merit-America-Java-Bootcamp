# Flexbox

**Flexbox** is short for Flexible Box Module. It's a relatively new layout tool in CSS that provides a flexible way to arrange items on a page. Since its introduction several years ago, it has been steadily working its way into common usage in web development and is supported by nearly 98% of the available browsers.

Flexbox dynamically handles alignment and the space between page items, which helps to save time. It consists of a **_flex container_** that contains one or more **_flex items_** which are constrained in their layout within the container using various flexbox properties specified by the developer.
