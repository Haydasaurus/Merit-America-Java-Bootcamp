# Item flow and order

## Applying normal flow to flexbox

Responsive design requires layouts to change relative to the screen size of the device in use. Flexbox supports this concept naturally using the `flex-wrap` property with a value of `wrap`:

```css
article {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

## Arranging items within a flexbox container using `order`

You may need to change the order of the items within a flexbox. By default, flexbox lays items out in the HTML source order. Traditionally, developers change the source order by moving content from one location to another in the HTML. Flexbox simplifies this through the use of the `order` property. The order property controls the order in which items appear in the flexbox container:

```css
#C {
  order: -1;
}
```

The `order` property takes a number as a value. Flexbox sorts items in a container by ascending order value and then by their source code order. Each item can have its own `order` value, and there can be duplicates.

In the case of duplicates, the process is to sort by `order` first and then sort by source order. As shown in the previous image, a negative value results in moving items earlier than the first item in the flow.

A positive number moves the item to the right relative to the first item, as shown below:

```css
#C {
  order: 3;
}
```
