# JavaScript Event Handling

When users interact with a web page, whether that's by scrolling, moving their mouse over elements, or clicking on forms or buttons, you can create certain JavaScript logic to respond to those events. In JavaScript, this is called **Event Handling**.

Built into the browser is a system that constantly notifies and processes events that are happening while the page loads. This includes browser events, like the DOM being successfully loaded or state changes in the display of the page, and user events, like mouse clicks or key presses.

This system is open enough that you can write JavaScript to listen for certain events and have your logic run as well when things happen. You can also write JavaScript that triggers certain events to mimic browser activity, or create your own custom events to add more capability to your application.

# The Browser Event Model

Browser events work in what's commonly called a **Publish and Subscribe** manner. Publish and Subscribe is a programmatic way to pass messages between different parts of a system while keeping those different parts decoupled from each other, meaning that the parts don't have to know about each other, they just need to know which messages to watch out for.

**Publishing** means that parts of the system can send messages out for other parts to act on, and **Subscribe** means that a part can listen for certain messages to be published and perform logic in response to it.

Back to a browser example: when a user clicks on a link, the UI can publish, or "trigger", a "click" event on that link. Another part of the browser can subscribe to, or "listen" for, that event and load the link as a new page.

This is called an **event-driven interface**. Most GUI applications follow this model in some way or another. With this model, you don't run your program's logic from start to finish, but you do write your program to listen for user-triggered events, and then run a small piece of logic in response to it. That logic can range anywhere from adding a class to a table row to saving a form full of user data to a backend system.

## Where do events happen?

In the browser, events are always attached to DOM elements. You can listen to events on links, buttons, input elements, tables, table rows and any other DOM element on the page.

When you want to listen for an event in your JavaScript, you first need to select the DOM element that you want to listen for events on. Then, you attach a function to that DOM element that you want triggered when the event happens.

## What are the events?

When an event is triggered, that event might have some information that gets sent along with it. If it's a mouse event, you'll get the X and Y coordinates of where it happened. If it's a keyboard event, you'll get the key that was pressed. This information can allow you to create powerful user interface interactions with your JavaScript.

# Listening for Events in JavaScript

Reacting to events in JavaScript requires three things:

1.  A DOM element that you want to listen to events on
2.  A specific event that you want to listen to
3.  A function that holds the logic that you want to execute

You already know how to select DOM elements. But how do you know what events you can listen for on a certain element?

## Types of events

All DOM elements can receive the following events:

-   `click` - a user has clicked on the DOM element
-   `dblclick` - a user has double-clicked on the DOM element
-   `mouseover` - a user has moved their mouse over the DOM element
-   `mouseout` - a user has moved their mouse out of the DOM element

Input elements, like `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>`, also trigger these events:

-   `keydown` - a user pressed down a key (including shift, alt, etc.) while on this DOM element
-   `keyup` - a user released a key (including shift, alt, etc.) while on this DOM element
-   `change` - a user has finished changing the value of this input element
-   `focus` - a user has selected this input element for editing
-   `blur` - a user has unselected this input element for editing

Form elements have these events:

-   `submit` - a user has submitted this form using a submit button or by hitting Enter on a text input element
-   `reset` - a user has reset this form using a reset button

There are many more events that you can listen for, but these are the ones you'll use most of the time. You can find more at the [MDN documentation for events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) .

## Adding event handlers to DOM elements

Imagine that you want to react to a user clicking on a button. When they click the button, you'll change the text in an `<h1>` to be different. The HTML for this might look something like this:

```html
<h1 id="greeting">Hello</h1>
<button id="change-greeting">Change Greeting</button>
```

First, you'd write a JavaScript function that does all the logic:

```js
function changeGreeting() {
    let greetingHeader = document.getElementById('greeting');
    greetingHeader.innerText = 'Goodbye';
}
```

Now, you want to get the DOM element you want to listen to the event on. You can get a reference to the button like this:

```js
let changeButton = document.getElementById('change-greeting');
```

Then you attach the function to run whenever there's a click event on the button:

```js
changeButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    changeGreeting();
});
```

That's the basics of event handling.

## Event handling using anonymous functions

You could also get the same capability by attaching an anonymous function as the event listener instead of calling a named function:

```js
changeButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    let greetingHeader = document.getElementById('greeting');
    greetingHeader.innerText = 'Goodbye';
});
```

These two examples are functionally the same, but you might have reasons to use one over the other.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Note: Best practices and Tech Elevator convention**
>
You'll see in all of the examples that event listeners are always structured as two different functions. You're encouraged you to follow this convention too.
>
The structure is that you first write your named function that implements the event handler logic:
>
>```js
>function changeGreeting() {
>    let greetingHeader = document.getElementById('greeting');
>    greetingHeader.innerText = 'Goodbye';
>}
>```
>
>And then call that in an event listener:
>
>```js
>let changeButton = document.getElementById('change-greeting');
>changeButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
>    changeGreeting();
>});
>```
>
>This is a best practice for several reasons. First, you can test the event handler as it's a normal JavaScript function. Secondly, it makes the code more flexible and able to handle HTML structure changes in the future.

## The event object

All event handlers receive an object when the event is triggered called the **Event Object**. This object holds many important properties that you can use to get information about what the event was.

To use this object, you can write your event handlers to take a parameter that holds the event object:

```js
(event) => {
    ...
}
```

In the function, you have access to an object that has details of the event that was triggered, including:

| **Property**                       | **Found In**              | **Purpose**                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| currentTarget                      | All events                | Holds the element that the event listener was registered on                                                                              |
| clientX                            | Mouse events              | The X coordinate on the screen of the click                                                                                              |
| clientY                            | Mouse events              | The Y coordinate on the screen of the click                                                                                              |
| altKey, metaKey, ctrlKey, shiftKey | Mouse and Keyboard events | A boolean on whether the specified key was pressed down during the event                                                                 |
| key                                | Keyboard events           | The key that was pressed, taking the Shift key into account. Arrow keys show up as 'ArrowRight', 'ArrowDown', 'ArrowLeft', and 'ArrowUp' |

# Special Cases

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you work with event handlers in your code.

## Bubbling and propagation

A single event doesn't just trigger on one element. It actually triggers on many elements, if you let it.

When an event triggers, it's triggered on the element that has been clicked or changed first. The browser runs any event listeners on that element, but then it doesn't stop there.

The browser then goes to that element's parent and triggers the event there too. This process is called **event propagation** or event bubbling. The browser continues to do this, triggering the event on up the parent tree until it gets to the `window` object that's the super parent of all the elements.

This is useful because there might be an instance where you want to handle events at different levels of the DOM tree. For instance, imagine that there's a table of rows that each have a text field in them. If a text field gets a `focusin` event, you might want to highlight that field:

```js
let textboxes = document.querySelectorAll('input.textboxes');
textboxes.forEach( (element) => {
    element.addEventListener('focusin', (event) => {
        // Here event.currentTarget is the input textbox
        toggleMarkClass(event.currentTarget);
    });
});
```

But you also might want to highlight the entire row by adding a `mark` class to that row. You could do that in the text field's event handler, but it would be much more flexible to do that in an event handler for the rows.

Since any `focusin` event that's triggered on the text box eventually bubbles up to the row level, you can add a `focusin` event handler on the row:

```js
let rows = document.querySelectorAll('table tr');
rows.forEach( (element) => {
    element.addEventListener('focusin', (event) => {
        /*
         * Here event.currentTarget is the row
         * even though the `focusin` event will initially
         * trigger on an input element in that row
         */
        toggleMarkClass(event.currentTarget);
    });
});
```

>**ðŸ›ˆ Tip: Use the correct target property**
>
>Because of event propagation, every Event object has two properties that deal with target elements:
>
| **Property**  | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| target        | Holds the element that the event was originally triggered on, like the button clicked or the select box that changed                                              |
| currentTarget | Holds the element that the event listener was registered on. This could be the same element as target, or an element up the parent tree from the original target. |

What if you don't want an event to keep bubbling up? To stop the propagation of an event, you can call the `stopPropagation()` method of the event object:

```js
let textboxes = document.querySelectorAll('input.textboxes');
textboxes.forEach( (element) => {
    element.addEventListener('focusin', (event) => {
        // Here event.currentTarget is the input textbox
        toggleMarkClass(event.currentTarget);

        // This stops the event here and does not call the event on any
        // parent element
        event.stopPropagation();
    });
});
```

You can read more about event propagation on this page from SitePoint: [Event Propagation and Bubbling](https://www.sitepoint.com/event-bubbling-javascript/) .

## Where to add event listeners

As mentioned in the previous unit, the DOM isn't created until the browser reads in the HTML. The timing of this isn't guaranteed, so your JavaScript could load and run before the DOM is fully ready.

But to attach event listeners to DOM elements, you need to be able to select elements from the DOM. Trying to get DOM elements from the DOM before the DOM is ready causes errors at run time.

To make sure that the DOM is fully ready before you attach your event listeners, you can listen for an event.

When the DOM is fully loaded into a browser, the browser itself triggers an event called `DOMContentLoaded` on the `document` object. What you need to do is add all of your event listeners inside of an anonymous function that only runs once the `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired:

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    // Register all of your event listeners here
});
```

### What about elements that are created and aren't yet on the DOM?

Often you'll create a new DOM element yourself or from a `template` and want some of its elements to have event handlers on them. Those elements don't exist when the page is loaded in the browser, so any registering of events in `DOMContentLoaded` won't happen for those new elements.

In that case, you'll need to attach those events after creating the DOM elements. This is typically done by writing a new function that takes the new DOM element and attaches the required event handlers. Then, after creating a new element, you pass it to the new function and then add that element to the living DOM.

## Default behavior for `a` and `form` elements

Some events triggers a browser's "default behavior." This includes `a` elements, where a browser attempts to navigate to new page by default when they're `click`ed, and `form` elements, where a browser calls a remote server by default when they're `submit`ted.

However, the browser always calls your JavaScript listeners before doing the default action. This gives you the ability to prevent the default action if you don't want it to happen. This is useful if you want to use `a` elements to toggle something on the page instead of navigating off of the site.

To do this, you need to use the `event` object that you get in your event listener and call `preventDefault()` on it:

```js
aLink.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    // Tells the browser to not perform its normal action
    event.preventDefault();

    // Then call the event handler
    toggleImage(event.currentTarget);
});
```

## `change` behavior on select and text controls

A `change` event only triggers once the action to make the change has completely finished and only happens after the field itself has blurred _and_ the value has actually changed.

For text input elements, `change` events only trigger once you click or tab out of the box, and then only if you actually change the value that was in the box. If you click in and then click out of the box, there's no change event. If you change a value and then change it back to what it was before clicking out, there's no change event.

This is something to be aware of depending on what kind of functionality you want.

For select elements, `change` events trigger when the user selects a new option. So this event won't wait for a blur event. It'll trigger right away when a new option is selected. However, it still won't trigger if the user selects the same option that was already picked.

## Unit testing with events

You don't usually unit test events triggering. You can, but you'll find yourself doing integration testing rather than unit testing. However, you can use named functions for your event handlers and then you can test your named functions like you always have.

# Quiz

## **Event Handling 1**

**What sort of action causes this event listener to run?**

```js
let button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    console.log('Hello');
});
```

â—‹ mousing over the button

â—‰ clicking on the button

â—‹ tabbing to the button

â—‹ logging a message to the console

**Explanation:** An element receives a `click` event when a pointing device buttonâ€”such as a mouse's primary buttonâ€”is both pressed and released while the pointer is inside the element.


## **Event Handling 2**

**What sort of action causes this event listener to run?**

```js
let textfield = document.querySelector('input[type=text]');
textfield.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
    console.log('Hello');
});
```

â—‹ clicking on the text input element

â—‹ mousing over the text input element

â—‹ typing in the text input element

â—‰ altering the text in the text input element and then clicking out of it

**Explanation:** The `change` event triggers when a user finishes changing the value of an input element. If you want to detect each change as it happens, listen for the `input` event instead.


## **Event Handling 3**

**What sort of action causes this event listener to run?**

```js
let textfield = document.querySelector('input[type=text]');
textfield.addEventListener('mouseover', (event) => {
    console.log('Hello');
});
```

â—‰ moving the mouse pointer onto the first text input element on the page

â—‹ moving the mouse pointer onto an element containing the first text input element

â—‹ moving the mouse pointer onto any text input element on the page

â—‹ moving the mouse pointer anywhere within the page

**Explanation:** `document.querySelector('input[type=text]')` returns the first text input on the page, and the attached event listener runs when the mouse pointer moves onto that element.


## **Event Handling 4**

**True or False: Every time a user moves the mouse inside a browser window, they're triggering events.**

â—‰ True

â—‹ False

**Explanation:** Many user actionsâ€”including moving the mouseâ€”trigger events whether or not there are any event listeners listening for them.


## **Event Handling 5**

**Given the following HTML, if a user clicked the button, which of the elements would receive a `click` event?**

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Quiz</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="main">
            <button name="submit">Send</button>
        </div>
        <img src="quiz.jpg">
    </body>
</html>
```

	Select all correct options

â–  `html`

â–¡ `head`

â–  `body`

â–  `div`

â–  `button`

â–¡ `img`

**Explanation:** The `click` event propagatesâ€”or bubblesâ€”up the DOM tree from the `button` to the `div` to the `body` to the `html` element.


## **Event Handling 6**

**A form field losing focus triggers which of the following events?**

â—‹ `mouseout`

â—‹ `focus`

â—‰ `blur`

â—‹ `mouseover`

â—‹ `click`

**Explanation:** `blur` is the opposite of `focus`â€”it's triggered when an element loses the input focus.


## **Event Handling 7**

**True or False: You can use the event object's `stopPropagation()` method to stop the browser from navigating to a new page when the user clicks an `a` element.**

â—‹ True

â—‰ False

**Explanation:** You'd use `stopPropagation()` to stop events from bubbling up through parent elements. To prevent a default action like navigating to a new page when clicking an `a` element, use `preventDefault()`.
