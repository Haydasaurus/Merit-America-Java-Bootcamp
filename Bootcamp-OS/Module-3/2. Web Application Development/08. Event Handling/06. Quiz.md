## **Event Handling 1**

**What sort of action causes this event listener to run?**

```js
let button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    console.log('Hello');
});
```

○ mousing over the button

◉ clicking on the button

○ tabbing to the button

○ logging a message to the console

**Explanation:** An element receives a `click` event when a pointing device button—such as a mouse's primary button—is both pressed and released while the pointer is inside the element.


## **Event Handling 2**

**What sort of action causes this event listener to run?**

```js
let textfield = document.querySelector('input[type=text]');
textfield.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
    console.log('Hello');
});
```

○ clicking on the text input element

○ mousing over the text input element

○ typing in the text input element

◉ altering the text in the text input element and then clicking out of it

**Explanation:** The `change` event triggers when a user finishes changing the value of an input element. If you want to detect each change as it happens, listen for the `input` event instead.


## **Event Handling 3**

**What sort of action causes this event listener to run?**

```js
let textfield = document.querySelector('input[type=text]');
textfield.addEventListener('mouseover', (event) => {
    console.log('Hello');
});
```

◉ moving the mouse pointer onto the first text input element on the page

○ moving the mouse pointer onto an element containing the first text input element

○ moving the mouse pointer onto any text input element on the page

○ moving the mouse pointer anywhere within the page

**Explanation:** `document.querySelector('input[type=text]')` returns the first text input on the page, and the attached event listener runs when the mouse pointer moves onto that element.


## **Event Handling 4**

**True or False: Every time a user moves the mouse inside a browser window, they're triggering events.**

◉ True

○ False

**Explanation:** Many user actions—including moving the mouse—trigger events whether or not there are any event listeners listening for them.


## **Event Handling 5**

**Given the following HTML, if a user clicked the button, which of the elements would receive a `click` event?**

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Quiz</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="main">
            <button name="submit">Send</button>
        </div>
        <img src="quiz.jpg">
    </body>
</html>
```

	Select all correct options

■ `html`

□ `head`

■ `body`

■ `div`

■ `button`

□ `img`

**Explanation:** The `click` event propagates—or bubbles—up the DOM tree from the `button` to the `div` to the `body` to the `html` element.


## **Event Handling 6**

**A form field losing focus triggers which of the following events?**

○ `mouseout`

○ `focus`

◉ `blur`

○ `mouseover`

○ `click`

**Explanation:** `blur` is the opposite of `focus`—it's triggered when an element loses the input focus.


## **Event Handling 7**

**True or False: You can use the event object's `stopPropagation()` method to stop the browser from navigating to a new page when the user clicks an `a` element.**

○ True

◉ False

**Explanation:** You'd use `stopPropagation()` to stop events from bubbling up through parent elements. To prevent a default action like navigating to a new page when clicking an `a` element, use `preventDefault()`.
