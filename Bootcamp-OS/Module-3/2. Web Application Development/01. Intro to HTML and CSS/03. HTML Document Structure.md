# HTML Document Structure

Each HTML document begins with same structure and builds from there. The first line of the document is `<!DOCTYPE html>`, which indicates that this is an HTML5 document.

Next is the HTML tag `<html>`, which is the root tag for your entire document. There can be only one `<html>` tag, and all other elements must be descendants of this tag.

>ðŸ›ˆ Note: HTML elements and tags
>
>An HTML _element_ is an individual component of HTML, such as its body, or a paragraph. An HTML _tag_ is the code used to indicate to the browser where an element begins and ends, such as `<p>...</p>`. You create HTML elements using HTML tags. Although there is a subtle difference in their definitions, most people use these terms interchangeably, as you'll see in this book.

Finally, there's the `<head>` and `<body>` tags:

-   `<head>`: The head is the part of an HTML document that contains **metadata** about that document, such as the author, description, and links to CSS or JavaScript files that apply to the HTML.
-   `<body>`: This element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one `<body>` element in a document.

The following code sample shows the basic HTML structure. If you paste this content into a new HTML document and open it in a browser, the browser opens it because it's a valid HTML document. However, you'd find yourself starting at a blank screen, as there's nothing to display:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- comment: metadata goes here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- comment: content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

One of the good things about HTML is that each HTML file starts with the same structure, so you don't have to write this code by hand. Most IDEs or text editors generate this for you.

You can generate the base HTML structure using **Emmet**, a tool that helps you write HTML and CSS faster. It's built into Visual Studio Code, so you don't have to download any extensions or plugins.

>âœ” Tip: Enabling Emmet in Visual Studio Code
>
>To make sure you have Emmet enabled in Visual Studio Code for Windows, go to **File > Preferences > Settings** (in Visual Studio Code for Mac, it's **Code > Preferences > Settings**). In the "Search settings" box, type "Emmet." You'll see a list of settings you can modify.

Scroll down until you see "Emmet: Trigger Expansion on Tab." If you see a checked box, the setting is already enabled. If it isn't, check the box to enable it.

Once you've enabled Emmet, you can use the shortcut `! + tab` to generate the base HTML structure:

If you did that correctly, you'll end up with this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

## Setting the page title

When building a new HTML document, you usually set the title of the page first. The page title is the text that appears in the tab of your browser window. You can set it using the `<title>` tag. The page title is metadata, which belongs in the `<head>` of your document.

Once you add the page title, here's what the document looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- metadata goes here -->
    <title>My Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Now that you've filled in some metadata, you can open your web page. You can open it in your browser of choice by double clicking on the file in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS), or you can open it through Visual Studio Code.

>âœ” Tip: Opening web pages in Visual Studio Code
>
If you want to open a web page from Visual Studio Code rather than going to your browser, you can use an extension called **Live Server**. You can check if you have the extension installed or install it using the **Extensions** tab in Visual Studio Code.
>
>To open the code example using Live Server, right click on the `index.html` file in the Explorer and select **Open with Live Server**.

When the browser opens the web page, you'll see your title in the tab:

![My Page Title](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080577-35136c37-3313-4343-b41d-c8f0cbe6442a.png)

## HTML tags

If you look in the code block, you'll notice that almost every HTML tag has a start and end tag. You saw this earlier with the `<head>` tag. There was an opening tag, `<head>`, and a closing tag, `</head>`. In between, there was a `<title>` tag. And inside the `<title>` tag was the text that set the page title:

```html
<head>
  <!-- metadata goes here -->
  <title>My Page Title</title>
</head>
```

There are also tags that don't have any content between them. If that's the case, you don't need a closing tag. These types of tags are **self-closing** tags:

```html
<!-- line break -->
<br />

<!-- horizontal rule -->
<hr />
```

## HTML attributes

Tags in HTML have **attributes**. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want. There are two types of attributes: global attributes, which apply to all HTML elements, and then attributes that apply to one or more elements.

You declare attributes on HTML tags using the attribute name and value. You already saw an example of an attribute in the `<html>` element:

```html
<html lang="en">
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
</html>
```

The `lang` global attribute defines the language of an element. Each element inherits global attributes and defines their own. If you visit the documentation for an element like [`<html>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html) , you'll see both the global and element-specific attributes.

If you want to see a list of all attributes, you can view them on the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes) about HTML attributes.
