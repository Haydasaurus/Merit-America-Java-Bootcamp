# Forms

HTML forms are one of the most important parts of a website. You can use them to collect information from your visitors. This could be something as simple as a contact form, mailing list sign-up form, or blog comment, all the way to an entire e-commerce checkout process.

All forms start with the same structure and use different elements to capture different types of data from your visitors.

## The form tag

The HTML `<form>` element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information:

```html
<form>
  <!-- form interactive controls -->
</form>
```

The form element has two attributes:

-   **action**: The URL that processes the form submission.
-   **method**: The HTTP method to submit the form with. Possible values:
    -   post: The `POST` method; form data sent as the request body.
    -   get: The `GET` method; form data appended to the action URL with a `?` separator.

Imagine that you had a login form that asked the user for their username and password. When they submit the form, their browser sends the information to your server using the `POST` method. An example login form might look like this:

```html
<form action="http://localhost:3000/api/users/login" method="POST">
  <!-- elements to capture username and password here -->
</form>
```

## Form elements

When building a form, it's important to understand what tools are available to you. There are many elements and variations of those elements that you can use to add interactive controls to your forms. In this section, you'll learn about the different form elements, when you might want to use them, and see some example code.

This example form has some of the interactive controls you'll learn about:

### Input

The `<input>` element is one of the most powerful elements in HTML because of the number of combinations of input types and attributes. When you define an input element, you start by setting the `name` attribute:

```html
<input name="firstName" />
```

When a user submits a form, the browser sends each input element to the server as a name-value pair. The name of the element is what you define in the `name` attribute, and the value is what the user typed in the input control. You need to define the names of your elements so that you can handle them when processing them on the server.

The next attribute you need to set is the `type`. How an `<input>` element works varies depending on the value of its `type` attribute. If this attribute isn't specified, the default type adopted is `text`:

```html
<input name="firstName" type="text" />
```

### Input types

The following is a list of common types and what they provide:

| **Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| button   | A push-button with no default behavior displaying the value of the value attribute, empty by default.                                                                                  |
| text     | A single-line text field. Line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value.                                                                                                  |
| checkbox | A checkbox allowing the user to select or de-select (check or un-check) the box. This normally represents a boolean (true/false or yes/no) choice.                                     |
| radio    | A radio button, allowing the user to select a single value out of multiple choices with the same name.                                                                                 |
| date     | A control for entering a date (year, month, and day, with no time). Opens a date picker or numeric wheels for year, month, day when active in supporting browsers.                     |
| email    | A field for editing an email address. Looks like a text input, but has validation parameters and relevant keyboard in supporting browsers and devices with dynamic keyboards.          |
| color    | A control for specifying a color; opening a color picker when active in supporting browsers.                                                                                           |
| file     | A control that lets the user select a file. Uses the accept attribute to define the types of files that the control can select.                                                        |
| number   | A control for entering a number. Displays a spinner and adds default validation when supported. Displays a numeric keypad in some devices with dynamic keypads, such as mobile phones. |
| submit   | A button that submits the form.                                                                                                                                                        |

### Input attributes

Because `<input>` has so many types, there is a long list of supported attributes based on type. Here are a few of the more common attributes you'll come across when working on input elements.

| **Attribute** | **Description**                                                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name          | Name of the input form control. Submitted with the form as part of a name-value pair.    |
| type          | Type of input form control.                                                              |
| value         | Current value of the form control. Submitted with the form as part of a name-value pair. |
| disabled      | Whether user can interact with the form control.                                         |
| minlength     | Minimum length (number of characters) of value.                                          |
| maxlength     | Maximum length (number of characters) of value.                                          |
| required      | Boolean. The user must supply a value for the form to be submittable.                    |

### Label

The HTML `<label>` element represents a caption for an item in a user interface. For example, you need to collect the first name, last name, and email address in a user registration form.

You start with your form element, create input controls, and give each of them unique names so you know which piece of data is which when the form is submitted to your server:

```html
<h1>Registration Form</h1>
<form>
  <input name="firstName" type="text" />
  <input name="lastName" type="text" />
  <input name="email" type="email" />
</form>
```

When this page loads, your users see the following:

![HTML Forms No Labels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080923-9a4dfe57-fc20-4668-bd56-8ecaf0a8da44.png)

This isn't user friendly because your users don't know what information to fill in. A better approach is to use the label element. The `for` attribute contains the `id` of a labelable form-related element in the same document as the `<label>` element. The value between the start and end label tag displays to the user:

```html
<h1>Registration Form</h1>
<form>
  <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
  <input id="firstName" name="firstName" type="text" />

  <label for="lastName">Last Name:</label>
  <input id="lastName" name="lastName" type="text" />

  <label for="email">Email Address:</label>
  <input id="email" name="email" type="email" />
</form>
```

![HTML Form with Labels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080959-5edd93c8-fea1-4fa2-832b-2617d8e27a34.png)

>ðŸ›ˆ Note: `Name` versus `id`
>
>Why do you need both the `id` and `name` attributes on a control? As you learned earlier, the `name` attribute determines the key of the data submitted to the server. The `id` attribute is a unique identifier given to an element that the browser uses and has no bearing of the key sent to the server. When you say `label for="firstName"`, you're assigning this label to an element with an `id` of `firstName`. These are two different attributes and there are often times when you need both.

### Textarea

You can use the input control to ask the user for some text, but what happens when you need paragraphs of text? The HTML `<textarea>` element represents a multi-line, plain-text editing control.

It's useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form textâ€”for example, a comment on a review or feedback form. In this example, it's used to allow users to enter information about themselves:

```html
<h1>Registration Form</h1>
<form>
  <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
  <input id="firstName" name="firstName" type="text" />
  <br />

  <label for="lastName">Last Name:</label>
  <input id="lastName" name="lastName" type="text" />
  <br />

  <label for="email">Email Address:</label>
  <input id="email" name="email" type="email" />
  <br /><br />

  <label for="about">Tell us about yourself:</label><br />
  <textarea id="about" name="about" rows="8" cols="60"></textarea>
</form>
```

The `rows` and `cols` attributes are one way to specify the exact size of the textarea. Setting these is a good idea for consistency, as browser defaults can differ.

![HTML Textarea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176081004-ac869b90-8f57-4281-a998-a30390b5a944.png)

### Select

The HTML `<select>` element represents a control that provides a menu of options:

```html
<form>
  <label for="department">Department:</label>
  <select id="department" name="department">
    <option value="">--Please choose an option--</option>
    <option value="sales">Sales</option>
    <option value="marketing">Marketing</option>
    <option value="IT">IT</option>
  </select>
</form>
```

Each menu option is an `<option>` element nested inside the `<select>` element. Each `<option>` element can have a `value` attribute containing the data value to submit to the server when that option is selected.

If you don't include the `value` attribute, the value defaults to the text contained inside the element. You can include a `selected` attribute on an `<option>` element so it's selected by default when the page loads for the first time.

By default, the `<select>` element only allows for a single choice. If you want to allow for multiple selections, you can use the `multiple` attribute:

```html
<form>
  <label for="favoriteFood">Favorite Foods</label>
  <select name="favoriteFood" id="favoriteFood" multiple="true">
    <option>Pizza</option>
    <option>Ice Cream</option>
    <option>Meat</option>
    <option>Seafood</option>
  </select>
</form>
```
