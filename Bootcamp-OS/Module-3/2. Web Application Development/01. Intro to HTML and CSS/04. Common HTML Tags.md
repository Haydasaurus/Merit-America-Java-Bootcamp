# Common HTML Tags

There are several HTML tags that you'll use frequently.

## Heading tags

There are six tags you can use to define headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`. They range in importance, from `<h1>` being the most important, to `<h6>` as the least.

The importance is typically displayed as varying text sizes. `<h1>` is the largest, `<h6>` the smallest. While it's tempting to use the heading tags to resize text, their intent is to indicate relative importance.

As a best practice, there should be only one `<h1>` tag per page, signifying the main topic or purpose of the page. Subsequent headings should descend as needed but without skipping heading tags. For instance, you shouldn't go from `<h2>` to `<h4>` without an intervening `<h3>`:

```html
<h1>Programming Languages</h1>
<h2>Imperative</h2>
<h3>Object-oriented</h3>
<h4>C#</h4>
<h4>Java</h4>
<h3>Functional</h3>
<h4>Haskell</h4>
<h4>Swift</h4>
<h2>Declarative</h2>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<h3>SQL</h3>
```

As the code example shows, there may be duplicate `<h2>` - `<h6>` tags within a page.

`<h1>` - `<h6>` tags have no special attributes of their own, but they do support the standard [global attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) . If you want to learn more about the six heading elements, see the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) about HTML heading elements.

## The paragraph tag

The `<p>` element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts a new line, with some margin before and after the paragraph added by the browser. The browser ignores any whitespace in the HTML document before or after the paragraph and doesn't display it:

```html
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
  incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Aliquet porttitor lacus luctus
  accumsan tortor posuere ac ut. Magna fermentum iaculis eu non diam phasellus
  vestibulum. Proin libero nunc consequat interdum. Pharetra convallis posuere
  morbi leo urna molestie at elementum eu.
</p>

<p>
  Pellentesque adipiscing commodo elit at imperdiet dui accumsan sit amet. Sed
  egestas egestas fringilla phasellus faucibus scelerisque eleifend donec
  pretium. Ipsum consequat nisl vel pretium lectus quam id leo in. Etiam tempor
  orci eu lobortis elementum nibh tellus molestie nunc.
</p>
```

`<p>` has no special attributes of its own, but does support the standard global attributes. If you want to learn more about `<p>` tag, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) .

## The emphasis tag

The emphasis, or `<em>` tag, emphasizes text. Typically, a browser displays emphasized text in **_italics_**. Interestingly, screen readers add verbal stress to emphasized text.

`<em>` has no special attributes of its own, but it does support the standard global attributes. If you want to learn more about the `<em>` tag, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em) .

Here's how you'd use the emphasis tag in a paragraph:

```html
<p>
  The multi-volume <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> by Donald E. Knuth
  is considered a classic.
</p>
```

## The strong tag

The `<strong>` tag defines **important** text. Important text is usually displayed in **bold**.

`<strong>` has no special attributes of its own, but it does support the standard global attributes. If you want to learn more about the `<strong>` tag, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) .

This is how you'd use the `<strong>` tag in a paragraph:

```html
<p>
  <strong>Stop!</strong>, look, and listen before calling your chicken from
  across the road.
</p>
```

## The blockquote tag

The `<blockquote>` is similar to a paragraph in terms of whitespace before, after, and within the blockquote. It differs from the paragraph in that the browser indents the text when displayed.

Unlike the paragraph which has no unique attributes, the `<blockquote>` has a single `cite` attribute which contains a URL to the source of the quotation. The `cite` attribute's URL isn't displayed, but search engines may use it to get more information about the quotation.

Besides the `cite` attribute, `<blockquote>` supports the standard global attributes. To learn more, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) .

This is how you'd use the `<blockquote>` tag:

```html
<p>As we like to say at Tech Elevator:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.techelevator.com">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Inventore sit
  accusamus itaque a vitae, atque eum nam ab explicabo repudiandae nesciunt
  sequi fugiat sint eveniet iste facilis quas distinctio voluptatum?
</blockquote>
```

## The anchor tag

The anchor, or `<a>`, tag, defines a hyperlink. It adds the _hyper_ to hypertext, and is at the heart of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and the web.

Given its power, the `<a>` is surprisingly straightforward. While it has over a half dozen attributes to choose from, the `href` is typically the only one used. It contains the URL of the page the link goes to. The `href` may link to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, and anything else a URL can address.

In addition to `href`, and the other `<a>`-specific attributes, `<a>` supports the standard global attributes. To learn more about the `<a>` tag, see the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) .

This is how you'd use the `<a>` tag:

```html
<a href="https://www.techelevator.com">Tech Elevator</a>
<a href="mailto:hello@techelevator.com">Contact Us</a>
```

## The image tag

The image, or `<img>` tag, links an image to a webpage and is a placeholder signifying where the image appears in the page.

The `<img>` element has one required attribute: `src`, and another _highly recommended_ attribute, `alt`. `src` specifies the path to the image. `alt` contains alternative text if the browser can't be display the image. Keep in mind that screen readers read the `alt` text out loud.

Here's how you use the `<img>` tag:

```html
<img src="img/te-stacked-logo.png" alt="Tech Elevator logo" />
```

To learn more about the `<img>` tag, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) .

## Ordered and unordered lists

There are two types of HTML lists: ordered `<ol>` and unordered `<ul>`. Both use the list item `<li>` tag to enumerate their items.

### Unordered list

The `<ul>` is the simpler of the two. Use it when the order of the items in the list is unimportant. Browsers typically display each item preceded by a bullet, like a circle, dot, or square.

You can nest `<ul>` tags within one another. Here's how you'd use them:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Imperative Languages</li>
  <ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Java</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Functional Languages</li>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
```

`<ul>` supports the standard global attributes. To learn more about unordered lists, read the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) .

### Ordered list

`<ol>` is similar to `<ul>`, but the order of the items in the list is important, and the browser displays each item preceded by a number or letter.

The `<ol>` list has three attributes, but only `start` is ever really used. `start` is always an integer value, even if a letter precedes each item. For instance, `start="4"` begins at "d" if the list is "numbering" items by letter.

In addition to the `<ol>`-specific attributes, `<ol>` supports the standard global attributes.

You can nest `<ol>` tags within one another. Here's how you'd use them:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Imperative Languages</li>
  <ol>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Java</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Functional Languages</li>
  <ol>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
```

To learn more about ordered lists, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) .

>✔ Tip: You can combine ordered and unordered lists
>
>You can nest `<ul>` under `<ol>` if you need a bulleted list under a numbered item, for example. Conversely, you can nest `<ol>` under `<ul>` if you need a numbered list under a bulleted item.

## The table tag

The `<table>` tag defines an HTML table that consists of table rows `<tr>`, and table data `<td>`, or column, elements. Table rows and data elements may be optionally grouped under `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` tags.

`<th>` is an alternative to `<td>`, and the two may be used interchangeably. The distinction is that `<th>` is usually displayed in larger, heavier font.

The `<table>` element and its related tags support the standard global attributes. To learn more about the `<table>` tag, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) .

Here is an example table:

```html
<p>Programming Languages by Year Released</p>
<table>
    <thead> <!-- optional tag -->
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Year Released</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>  <!-- optional tag -->
        <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>1972</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Java</td>
            <td>1996</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>JavaScript</td>
            <td>1996</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C#</td>
            <td>2002</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Rust</td>
            <td>2010</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Swift</td>
            <td>2014</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kotlin</td>
            <td>2016</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>  <!-- optional tag -->
      <tr>
        <td>Ordered by year released.</td>
      </tr>
    </tfoot>
</table>
```

>⚠ **Warning: Formatting with complex tables is not good practice**
>
>Much more complex tables are possible with tables nested inside tables, and columns and rows spanned together using the `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes. **_This is generally considered bad practice because assistive technology, such as screen readers, may not be able to correctly parse them._**
