# HTML and CSS

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks of the web. Each of these languages play their own significant roles in building the web:

-   HTML: Provides the basic structure or markup of a document.
-   CSS: Provides formatting of the document to control presentation and layout.
-   JavaScript: Provides behavior to the document.

![HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080039-96322a6d-a93b-4ef0-9e33-856d461d526d.png)

Web development is about understanding each of these independently and how they work together to produce the web.

# Intro to HTML

HTML stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. HTML is a markup language, which means that you take the raw content you want to display and structure it using HTML tags. These tags tell a web browser how to display and structure your content.

Consider the following text:

```
This is a heading! This is a paragraph. This is another paragraph.
```

To the browser, this is all text that has no special meaning.

Now, consider the same text marked up with HTML tags:

```html
<h1>This is a heading!</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

When the browser parses this document, it sees that you've placed emphasis on the first line of text ("This is a heading!") and that it must be a heading in your document. The next two lines of text are paragraphs and display differently than the first line.

## Getting started

Some of the advantages of doing web development with HTML and CSS are that you can start working with the languages pretty quickly, and they have a fast feedback loop.

To get started, you need a web browser and a text editor, both of which are already installed on your machine. You'll use Visual Studio Code, which is the most popular editor for a variety of languages.

To start working with HTML, you'll need to create a new file called `index.html`.

>**🛈 Note: Why index.html?**
>
>When you visit a website without a document name specified, like http://www.example.com, the server often returns a default document like `index.html`. There are many typical default document names like `default.html` and `index.php`, but one of the most common names is `index.html`.

After you create your `index.html` document, you need to start building out the document's structure.

>**🛈 Note: Whitespace in HTML**
>
>Many of the following HTML samples use indentations and the occasional blank line for the sake of clarity. HTML requires neither indentation nor blank lines. These are examples of "whitespace", which is generally ignored by browsers when reading HTML.

# HTML Document Structure

Each HTML document begins with same structure and builds from there. The first line of the document is `<!DOCTYPE html>`, which indicates that this is an HTML5 document.

Next is the HTML tag `<html>`, which is the root tag for your entire document. There can be only one `<html>` tag, and all other elements must be descendants of this tag.

>**🛈 Note: HTML elements and tags**
>
>An HTML _element_ is an individual component of HTML, such as its body, or a paragraph. An HTML _tag_ is the code used to indicate to the browser where an element begins and ends, such as `<p>...</p>`. You create HTML elements using HTML tags. Although there is a subtle difference in their definitions, most people use these terms interchangeably, as you'll see in this book.

Finally, there's the `<head>` and `<body>` tags:

-   `<head>`: The head is the part of an HTML document that contains **metadata** about that document, such as the author, description, and links to CSS or JavaScript files that apply to the HTML.
-   `<body>`: This element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one `<body>` element in a document.

The following code sample shows the basic HTML structure. If you paste this content into a new HTML document and open it in a browser, the browser opens it because it's a valid HTML document. However, you'd find yourself starting at a blank screen, as there's nothing to display:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- comment: metadata goes here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- comment: content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

One of the good things about HTML is that each HTML file starts with the same structure, so you don't have to write this code by hand. Most IDEs or text editors generate this for you.

You can generate the base HTML structure using **Emmet**, a tool that helps you write HTML and CSS faster. It's built into Visual Studio Code, so you don't have to download any extensions or plugins.

>**✔ Tip: Enabling Emmet in Visual Studio Code**
>
>To make sure you have Emmet enabled in Visual Studio Code for Windows, go to **File > Preferences > Settings** (in Visual Studio Code for Mac, it's **Code > Preferences > Settings**). In the "Search settings" box, type "Emmet." You'll see a list of settings you can modify.

Scroll down until you see "Emmet: Trigger Expansion on Tab." If you see a checked box, the setting is already enabled. If it isn't, check the box to enable it.

Once you've enabled Emmet, you can use the shortcut `! + tab` to generate the base HTML structure:

![HTML Base Structure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080374-737561d9-06d0-4e18-890c-4eaea213b7a6.gif)

![HTML Base Structure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080398-a4faaef0-ca47-4012-a762-63817be8df98.gif)

If you did that correctly, you'll end up with this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

## Setting the page title

When building a new HTML document, you usually set the title of the page first. The page title is the text that appears in the tab of your browser window. You can set it using the `<title>` tag. The page title is metadata, which belongs in the `<head>` of your document.

Once you add the page title, here's what the document looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- metadata goes here -->
    <title>My Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Now that you've filled in some metadata, you can open your web page. You can open it in your browser of choice by double clicking on the file in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS), or you can open it through Visual Studio Code.

>**✔ Tip: Opening web pages in Visual Studio Code**
>
If you want to open a web page from Visual Studio Code rather than going to your browser, you can use an extension called **Live Server**. You can check if you have the extension installed or install it using the **Extensions** tab in Visual Studio Code.
>
>To open the code example using Live Server, right click on the `index.html` file in the Explorer and select **Open with Live Server**.
>
>![Opening Live Server on Windows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080516-09c89f56-1292-4c88-ad19-2e5caa6e5743.gif)
>
>![Opening Live Server on Mac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080549-ec33270f-668c-4cdf-bebb-7d63e0c79bac.gif)


When the browser opens the web page, you'll see your title in the tab:

![My Page Title](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080577-35136c37-3313-4343-b41d-c8f0cbe6442a.png)

## HTML tags

If you look in the code block, you'll notice that almost every HTML tag has a start and end tag. You saw this earlier with the `<head>` tag. There was an opening tag, `<head>`, and a closing tag, `</head>`. In between, there was a `<title>` tag. And inside the `<title>` tag was the text that set the page title:

```html
<head>
  <!-- metadata goes here -->
  <title>My Page Title</title>
</head>
```

There are also tags that don't have any content between them. If that's the case, you don't need a closing tag. These types of tags are **self-closing** tags:

```html
<!-- line break -->
<br />

<!-- horizontal rule -->
<hr />
```

## HTML attributes

Tags in HTML have **attributes**. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want. There are two types of attributes: global attributes, which apply to all HTML elements, and then attributes that apply to one or more elements.

You declare attributes on HTML tags using the attribute name and value. You already saw an example of an attribute in the `<html>` element:

```html
<html lang="en">
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
</html>
```

The `lang` global attribute defines the language of an element. Each element inherits global attributes and defines their own. If you visit the documentation for an element like [`<html>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html) , you'll see both the global and element-specific attributes.

If you want to see a list of all attributes, you can view them on the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes) about HTML attributes.

# Common HTML Tags

There are several HTML tags that you'll use frequently.

## Heading tags

There are six tags you can use to define headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`. They range in importance, from `<h1>` being the most important, to `<h6>` as the least.

The importance is typically displayed as varying text sizes. `<h1>` is the largest, `<h6>` the smallest. While it's tempting to use the heading tags to resize text, their intent is to indicate relative importance.

As a best practice, there should be only one `<h1>` tag per page, signifying the main topic or purpose of the page. Subsequent headings should descend as needed but without skipping heading tags. For instance, you shouldn't go from `<h2>` to `<h4>` without an intervening `<h3>`:

```html
<h1>Programming Languages</h1>
<h2>Imperative</h2>
<h3>Object-oriented</h3>
<h4>C#</h4>
<h4>Java</h4>
<h3>Functional</h3>
<h4>Haskell</h4>
<h4>Swift</h4>
<h2>Declarative</h2>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<h3>SQL</h3>
```

As the code example shows, there may be duplicate `<h2>` - `<h6>` tags within a page.

`<h1>` - `<h6>` tags have no special attributes of their own, but they do support the standard [global attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) . If you want to learn more about the six heading elements, see the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) about HTML heading elements.

## The paragraph tag

The `<p>` element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts a new line, with some margin before and after the paragraph added by the browser. The browser ignores any whitespace in the HTML document before or after the paragraph and doesn't display it:

```html
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
  incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Aliquet porttitor lacus luctus
  accumsan tortor posuere ac ut. Magna fermentum iaculis eu non diam phasellus
  vestibulum. Proin libero nunc consequat interdum. Pharetra convallis posuere
  morbi leo urna molestie at elementum eu.
</p>

<p>
  Pellentesque adipiscing commodo elit at imperdiet dui accumsan sit amet. Sed
  egestas egestas fringilla phasellus faucibus scelerisque eleifend donec
  pretium. Ipsum consequat nisl vel pretium lectus quam id leo in. Etiam tempor
  orci eu lobortis elementum nibh tellus molestie nunc.
</p>
```

`<p>` has no special attributes of its own, but does support the standard global attributes. If you want to learn more about `<p>` tag, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) .

## The emphasis tag

The emphasis, or `<em>` tag, emphasizes text. Typically, a browser displays emphasized text in **_italics_**. Interestingly, screen readers add verbal stress to emphasized text.

`<em>` has no special attributes of its own, but it does support the standard global attributes. If you want to learn more about the `<em>` tag, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em) .

Here's how you'd use the emphasis tag in a paragraph:

```html
<p>
  The multi-volume <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> by Donald E. Knuth
  is considered a classic.
</p>
```

## The strong tag

The `<strong>` tag defines **important** text. Important text is usually displayed in **bold**.

`<strong>` has no special attributes of its own, but it does support the standard global attributes. If you want to learn more about the `<strong>` tag, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) .

This is how you'd use the `<strong>` tag in a paragraph:

```html
<p>
  <strong>Stop!</strong>, look, and listen before calling your chicken from
  across the road.
</p>
```

## The blockquote tag

The `<blockquote>` is similar to a paragraph in terms of whitespace before, after, and within the blockquote. It differs from the paragraph in that the browser indents the text when displayed.

Unlike the paragraph which has no unique attributes, the `<blockquote>` has a single `cite` attribute which contains a URL to the source of the quotation. The `cite` attribute's URL isn't displayed, but search engines may use it to get more information about the quotation.

Besides the `cite` attribute, `<blockquote>` supports the standard global attributes. To learn more, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) .

This is how you'd use the `<blockquote>` tag:

```html
<p>As we like to say at Tech Elevator:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.techelevator.com">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Inventore sit
  accusamus itaque a vitae, atque eum nam ab explicabo repudiandae nesciunt
  sequi fugiat sint eveniet iste facilis quas distinctio voluptatum?
</blockquote>
```

## The anchor tag

The anchor, or `<a>`, tag, defines a hyperlink. It adds the _hyper_ to hypertext, and is at the heart of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and the web.

Given its power, the `<a>` is surprisingly straightforward. While it has over a half dozen attributes to choose from, the `href` is typically the only one used. It contains the URL of the page the link goes to. The `href` may link to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, and anything else a URL can address.

In addition to `href`, and the other `<a>`-specific attributes, `<a>` supports the standard global attributes. To learn more about the `<a>` tag, see the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) .

This is how you'd use the `<a>` tag:

```html
<a href="https://www.techelevator.com">Tech Elevator</a>
<a href="mailto:hello@techelevator.com">Contact Us</a>
```

## The image tag

The image, or `<img>` tag, links an image to a webpage and is a placeholder signifying where the image appears in the page.

The `<img>` element has one required attribute: `src`, and another _highly recommended_ attribute, `alt`. `src` specifies the path to the image. `alt` contains alternative text if the browser can't be display the image. Keep in mind that screen readers read the `alt` text out loud.

Here's how you use the `<img>` tag:

```html
<img src="img/te-stacked-logo.png" alt="Tech Elevator logo" />
```

To learn more about the `<img>` tag, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) .

## Ordered and unordered lists

There are two types of HTML lists: ordered `<ol>` and unordered `<ul>`. Both use the list item `<li>` tag to enumerate their items.

### Unordered list

The `<ul>` is the simpler of the two. Use it when the order of the items in the list is unimportant. Browsers typically display each item preceded by a bullet, like a circle, dot, or square.

You can nest `<ul>` tags within one another. Here's how you'd use them:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Imperative Languages</li>
  <ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Java</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Functional Languages</li>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
```

`<ul>` supports the standard global attributes. To learn more about unordered lists, read the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) .

### Ordered list

`<ol>` is similar to `<ul>`, but the order of the items in the list is important, and the browser displays each item preceded by a number or letter.

The `<ol>` list has three attributes, but only `start` is ever really used. `start` is always an integer value, even if a letter precedes each item. For instance, `start="4"` begins at "d" if the list is "numbering" items by letter.

In addition to the `<ol>`-specific attributes, `<ol>` supports the standard global attributes.

You can nest `<ol>` tags within one another. Here's how you'd use them:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Imperative Languages</li>
  <ol>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Java</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Functional Languages</li>
  <ol>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
```

To learn more about ordered lists, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) .

>**✔ Tip: You can combine ordered and unordered lists**
>
>You can nest `<ul>` under `<ol>` if you need a bulleted list under a numbered item, for example. Conversely, you can nest `<ol>` under `<ul>` if you need a numbered list under a bulleted item.

## The table tag

The `<table>` tag defines an HTML table that consists of table rows `<tr>`, and table data `<td>`, or column, elements. Table rows and data elements may be optionally grouped under `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` tags.

`<th>` is an alternative to `<td>`, and the two may be used interchangeably. The distinction is that `<th>` is usually displayed in larger, heavier font.

The `<table>` element and its related tags support the standard global attributes. To learn more about the `<table>` tag, visit the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) .

Here is an example table:

```html
<p>Programming Languages by Year Released</p>
<table>
    <thead> <!-- optional tag -->
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Year Released</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>  <!-- optional tag -->
        <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>1972</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Java</td>
            <td>1996</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>JavaScript</td>
            <td>1996</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C#</td>
            <td>2002</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Rust</td>
            <td>2010</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Swift</td>
            <td>2014</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kotlin</td>
            <td>2016</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>  <!-- optional tag -->
      <tr>
        <td>Ordered by year released.</td>
      </tr>
    </tfoot>
</table>
```

>⚠ **Warning: Formatting with complex tables is not good practice**
>
>Much more complex tables are possible with tables nested inside tables, and columns and rows spanned together using the `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes. **_This is generally considered bad practice because assistive technology, such as screen readers, may not be able to correctly parse them._**

# Forms

HTML forms are one of the most important parts of a website. You can use them to collect information from your visitors. This could be something as simple as a contact form, mailing list sign-up form, or blog comment, all the way to an entire e-commerce checkout process.

All forms start with the same structure and use different elements to capture different types of data from your visitors.

## The form tag

The HTML `<form>` element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information:

```html
<form>
  <!-- form interactive controls -->
</form>
```

The form element has two attributes:

-   **action**: The URL that processes the form submission.
-   **method**: The HTTP method to submit the form with. Possible values:
    -   post: The `POST` method; form data sent as the request body.
    -   get: The `GET` method; form data appended to the action URL with a `?` separator.

Imagine that you had a login form that asked the user for their username and password. When they submit the form, their browser sends the information to your server using the `POST` method. An example login form might look like this:

```html
<form action="http://localhost:3000/api/users/login" method="POST">
  <!-- elements to capture username and password here -->
</form>
```

## Form elements

When building a form, it's important to understand what tools are available to you. There are many elements and variations of those elements that you can use to add interactive controls to your forms. In this section, you'll learn about the different form elements, when you might want to use them, and see some example code.

This example form has some of the interactive controls you'll learn about:

![Form Interactive Controls](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080872-a0cd8bec-61d9-4026-9150-b5485ae6b6ee.png)

### Input

The `<input>` element is one of the most powerful elements in HTML because of the number of combinations of input types and attributes. When you define an input element, you start by setting the `name` attribute:

```html
<input name="firstName" />
```

When a user submits a form, the browser sends each input element to the server as a name-value pair. The name of the element is what you define in the `name` attribute, and the value is what the user typed in the input control. You need to define the names of your elements so that you can handle them when processing them on the server.

The next attribute you need to set is the `type`. How an `<input>` element works varies depending on the value of its `type` attribute. If this attribute isn't specified, the default type adopted is `text`:

```html
<input name="firstName" type="text" />
```

### Input types

The following is a list of common types and what they provide:

| **Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| button   | A push-button with no default behavior displaying the value of the value attribute, empty by default.                                                                                  |
| text     | A single-line text field. Line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value.                                                                                                  |
| checkbox | A checkbox allowing the user to select or de-select (check or un-check) the box. This normally represents a boolean (true/false or yes/no) choice.                                     |
| radio    | A radio button, allowing the user to select a single value out of multiple choices with the same name.                                                                                 |
| date     | A control for entering a date (year, month, and day, with no time). Opens a date picker or numeric wheels for year, month, day when active in supporting browsers.                     |
| email    | A field for editing an email address. Looks like a text input, but has validation parameters and relevant keyboard in supporting browsers and devices with dynamic keyboards.          |
| color    | A control for specifying a color; opening a color picker when active in supporting browsers.                                                                                           |
| file     | A control that lets the user select a file. Uses the accept attribute to define the types of files that the control can select.                                                        |
| number   | A control for entering a number. Displays a spinner and adds default validation when supported. Displays a numeric keypad in some devices with dynamic keypads, such as mobile phones. |
| submit   | A button that submits the form.                                                                                                                                                        |

If you want to see the full list of types, see the [Input Element MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#%3Cinput%3E_types) .

### Input attributes

Because `<input>` has so many types, there is a long list of supported attributes based on type. Here are a few of the more common attributes you'll come across when working on input elements.

| **Attribute** | **Description**                                                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name          | Name of the input form control. Submitted with the form as part of a name-value pair.    |
| type          | Type of input form control.                                                              |
| value         | Current value of the form control. Submitted with the form as part of a name-value pair. |
| disabled      | Whether user can interact with the form control.                                         |
| minlength     | Minimum length (number of characters) of value.                                          |
| maxlength     | Maximum length (number of characters) of value.                                          |
| required      | Boolean. The user must supply a value for the form to be submittable.                    |

### Label

The HTML `<label>` element represents a caption for an item in a user interface. For example, you need to collect the first name, last name, and email address in a user registration form.

You start with your form element, create input controls, and give each of them unique names so you know which piece of data is which when the form is submitted to your server:

```html
<h1>Registration Form</h1>
<form>
  <input name="firstName" type="text" />
  <input name="lastName" type="text" />
  <input name="email" type="email" />
</form>
```

When this page loads, your users see the following:

![HTML Forms No Labels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080923-9a4dfe57-fc20-4668-bd56-8ecaf0a8da44.png)

This isn't user friendly because your users don't know what information to fill in. A better approach is to use the label element. The `for` attribute contains the `id` of a labelable form-related element in the same document as the `<label>` element. The value between the start and end label tag displays to the user:

```html
<h1>Registration Form</h1>
<form>
  <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
  <input id="firstName" name="firstName" type="text" />

  <label for="lastName">Last Name:</label>
  <input id="lastName" name="lastName" type="text" />

  <label for="email">Email Address:</label>
  <input id="email" name="email" type="email" />
</form>
```

![HTML Form with Labels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176080959-5edd93c8-fea1-4fa2-832b-2617d8e27a34.png)

>**🛈 Note: `Name` versus `id`**
>
>Why do you need both the `id` and `name` attributes on a control? As you learned earlier, the `name` attribute determines the key of the data submitted to the server. The `id` attribute is a unique identifier given to an element that the browser uses and has no bearing of the key sent to the server. When you say `label for="firstName"`, you're assigning this label to an element with an `id` of `firstName`. These are two different attributes and there are often times when you need both.

### Textarea

You can use the input control to ask the user for some text, but what happens when you need paragraphs of text? The HTML `<textarea>` element represents a multi-line, plain-text editing control.

It's useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text—for example, a comment on a review or feedback form. In this example, it's used to allow users to enter information about themselves:

```html
<h1>Registration Form</h1>
<form>
  <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
  <input id="firstName" name="firstName" type="text" />
  <br />

  <label for="lastName">Last Name:</label>
  <input id="lastName" name="lastName" type="text" />
  <br />

  <label for="email">Email Address:</label>
  <input id="email" name="email" type="email" />
  <br /><br />

  <label for="about">Tell us about yourself:</label><br />
  <textarea id="about" name="about" rows="8" cols="60"></textarea>
</form>
```

The `rows` and `cols` attributes are one way to specify the exact size of the textarea. Setting these is a good idea for consistency, as browser defaults can differ.

![HTML Textarea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176081004-ac869b90-8f57-4281-a998-a30390b5a944.png)

### Select

The HTML `<select>` element represents a control that provides a menu of options:

```html
<form>
  <label for="department">Department:</label>
  <select id="department" name="department">
    <option value="">--Please choose an option--</option>
    <option value="sales">Sales</option>
    <option value="marketing">Marketing</option>
    <option value="IT">IT</option>
  </select>
</form>
```

Each menu option is an `<option>` element nested inside the `<select>` element. Each `<option>` element can have a `value` attribute containing the data value to submit to the server when that option is selected.

If you don't include the `value` attribute, the value defaults to the text contained inside the element. You can include a `selected` attribute on an `<option>` element so it's selected by default when the page loads for the first time.

By default, the `<select>` element only allows for a single choice. If you want to allow for multiple selections, you can use the `multiple` attribute:

```html
<form>
  <label for="favoriteFood">Favorite Foods</label>
  <select name="favoriteFood" id="favoriteFood" multiple="true">
    <option>Pizza</option>
    <option>Ice Cream</option>
    <option>Meat</option>
    <option>Seafood</option>
  </select>
</form>
```

# Semantic HTML

The word **_semantic_** means, "of or relating to meaning in language." If you're using semantic HTML, you're using elements that have meaning6 to them.

Sematic HTML is a key component to a much larger and ambitious project, the Semantic Web. Originally proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, the Semantic Web allows for more intelligent searches and knitting together of knowledge than is possible with simple word matches. This is because semantic HTML tags provide additional context or meaning to the words beyond the fact they match.

Another advantage of using semantic HTML is that your website becomes more accessible. **Accessibility** is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.

When most people think of accessibility, they think of a person who is visually impaired and uses a screen reader to navigate the web. Making websites more accessible also includes those using mobile devices or those with slower internet connections.

You've already seen examples of semantic HTML with the `form` and `table` elements. When you see the `form` element, you know that this element has meaning. What follows is one or more controls to collect information. When you see the `table` element, you expect to see data in rows and columns:

```html
<form>
  <!-- form controls -->
</form>

<table>
  <!-- rows and columns -->
</table>
```

To gain a better understanding of what semantic HTML means, consider a non-semantic web page. A non-semantic web page is typically built around `<div>` tags. A `<div>` is the generic container for content.

Read through the following code sample. Note how the content is broken up into several `<div>` groups. Each group has a purpose, but because there is no standard semantic way of distinguishing one `<div>` from another, the purpose, or meaning, of each grouping remains unknown:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Content</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Blog</h1>
    <div>
      <ul id="myNavigation">
        <li>one</li>
        <li>two</li>
        <li>three</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="leftside">
      <ul id="categories">
        <li>one</li>
        <li>two</li>
        <li>three</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>My Article</h2>
      <p>
        Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nam illum
        earum voluptas ab quod, omnis ut incidunt repudiandae nemo adipisci

        porro voluptatum quidem nostrum illum voluptates ipsa autem temporibus
        eius? Error recusandae id deleniti maiores itaque quidem facilis ducimus
        molestiae dolorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cum, veniam assumenda eius, libero, ipsam praesentium ad sunt natus
        omnis impedit similique iure in voluptatibus qui ducimus soluta! Cumque

      </p>

    <div>
      Ads
    </div>
    <div id="footer">
      My Footer
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**_You_** can read the HTML, and figure out that the first `<div>` relates to navigation, and the second seems to have something to do with an aside, but a **_computer_** can't. It needs semantic tags to understand that some content relates to navigation, while other content belongs to asides, articles, and footers.

There are over a dozen Semantic HTML elements. The following are the most commonly used:

-   `<header>`
-   `<footer>`
-   `<nav>`
-   `<article>`
-   `<section>`
-   `<aside>`
-   `<main>`

## Header

The [`<header>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header) element is a container for other items. There are no definitive rules that stating what goes in or stays out of a `<header>`, but they typically contain a combination of headings, navigational links, author or company name, and logos.

Although the name implies there is only one `<header>` per page, it's possible for a page to have multiple headers.

The `class` attribute is commonly used to distinguish `<header>` tags within the same page:

```html
<header class="page-header">
  <a href="https://www.techelevator.com"
    ><img src="img/te-stacked-logo.png" alt="Tech Elevator logo"
  /></a>
  <p>Learn to code -- control your future</p>
</header>

<header class="main-headline">
  <p>Main Headline</p>
</header>
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
  incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Aliquet porttitor lacus luctus
  accumsan tortor posuere ac ut. Magna fermentum iaculis eu non diam phasellus
  vestibulum. Proin libero nunc consequat interdum. Pharetra convallis posuere
  morbi leo urna molestie at elementum eu.
</p>

<header class="sub-headline">
  <p>Sub Headline</p>
</header>
<p>
  Pellentesque adipiscing commodo elit at imperdiet dui accumsan sit amet. Sed
  egestas egestas fringilla phasellus faucibus scelerisque eleifend donec
  pretium. Ipsum consequat nisl vel pretium lectus quam id leo in. Etiam tempor
  orci eu lobortis elementum nibh tellus molestie nunc.
</p>
```

## Footer

The HTML [`<footer>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer) element is the counterpart to the `<header>` tag. Like the header, there are no specific rules around its contents, but a footer typically contains information about the author or company, copyright notice, and links to related pages.

Although unusual, there may be multiple footers in a page:

```html
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
  incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Aliquet porttitor lacus luctus
  accumsan tortor posuere ac ut. Magna fermentum iaculis eu non diam phasellus
  vestibulum. Proin libero nunc consequat interdum. Pharetra convallis posuere
  morbi leo urna molestie at elementum eu.
</p>
<footer class="author">
  <p>Written for Tech Elevator by Lorem Ipsum</p>
</footer>

<p>
  Pellentesque adipiscing commodo elit at imperdiet dui accumsan sit amet. Sed
  egestas egestas fringilla phasellus faucibus scelerisque eleifend donec
  pretium. Ipsum consequat nisl vel pretium lectus quam id leo in. Etiam tempor
  orci eu lobortis elementum nibh tellus molestie nunc.
</p>
<footer class="copyright">
  <p>Contents copyright of Tech Elevator, &copy;, 2021.</p>
</footer>
```

## Nav

The HTML [`<nav>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav) tag represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links. Common examples of navigation sections are menus and tables of contents. The navigation links can be external or internal:

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.techelevator.com">Tech Elevator</a></li>
    <li><a href="#current-blog">Current Blog</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

## Article

The HTML [`<article>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) tag represents a stand-alone document within a page. For instance, a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry are all examples of stand-alone documents within a page:

```html
<article>
  <h1>Programming Languages: The first 5,000 years</h1>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Aliquet porttitor lacus
    luctus accumsan tortor posuere ac ut. Magna fermentum iaculis eu non diam
    phasellus vestibulum. Proin libero nunc consequat interdum. Pharetra
    convallis posuere morbi leo urna molestie at elementum eu.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pellentesque adipiscing commodo elit at imperdiet dui accumsan sit amet. Sed
    egestas egestas fringilla phasellus faucibus scelerisque eleifend donec
    pretium. Ipsum consequat nisl vel pretium lectus quam id leo in. Etiam
    tempor orci eu lobortis elementum nibh tellus molestie nunc.
  </p>
</article>
```

## Section

The HTML [`<section>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section) represents a stand-alone section that doesn't have a more specific semantic tag to represent it. Typically, but not always, sections have a heading. It's possible to have multiple sections within a page.

You can nest `<sections>` inside `<articles>`, or nest `<articles>` inside `<sections>`. In other words, you can have sections within an article, a section of articles, or a section of articles which in turn contain sections. You decide how best to structure content.

The following sample code contains several sections:

```html
<article>
  <h1>Programming Languages: The first 5,000 years</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Clay tablets and Styli</h2>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
      incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Aliquet porttitor lacus luctus
      accumsan tortor posuere ac ut. Magna fermentum iaculis eu non diam phasellus
      vestibulum. Proin libero nunc consequat interdum. Pharetra convallis posuere
      morbi leo urna molestie at elementum eu.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>The Flintstones Awards: Precursor to the Turing</h2>
    <p>
      Pellentesque adipiscing commodo elit at imperdiet dui accumsan sit amet. Sed
      egestas egestas fringilla phasellus faucibus scelerisque eleifend donec
      pretium. Ipsum consequat nisl vel pretium lectus quam id leo in. Etiam tempor
      orci eu lobortis elementum nibh tellus molestie nunc.
    </p>
  </section>
</article>
```

## Aside

The HTML [`<aside>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside) tag defines a portion of a page which is only indirectly related to the main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes:

```html
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
  incididunt ut labore et dolore magna liqua. Aliquet porttitor lacus luctus
  accumsan tortor posuere ac ut. Magna fermentum iaculis eu non diam phasellus
  vestibulum. Proin libero nunc consequat interdum. Pharetra convallis posuere
  morbi leo urna molestie at elementum eu.
</p>
<aside>
  Note: the eisumod is tempor of the incididunt.
</aside>
<p>
  Pellentesque adipiscing commodo elit at imperdiet dui accumsan sit amet. Sed
  egestas egestas fringilla phasellus faucibus scelerisque* eleifend donec
  pretium. Ipsum consequat nisl vel pretium lectus quam id leo in. Etiam tempor
  orci eu lobortis elementum nibh tellus molestie nunc.
</p>
<aside>
  * Further evidence regarding the faucibus scelerisque debacle.
</aside>
```

## Main

The HTML [`<main>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main) tag contains the primary content directly related to the `<body>` of a page. There should be only a single `<main>` tag per page.

The page `<header>` and `<footer>` typically bracket the `<main>` tag:

```
<body>
  <header>
    <a href="https://www.techelevator.com"
      ><img src="img/te-stacked-logo.png" alt="Tech Elevator logo"
    /></a>
    <p>Learn to code -- control your future</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
      tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna liqua. Aliquet porttitor lacus
      luctus accumsan tortor posuere ac ut. Magna fermentum iaculis eu non diam
      phasellus vestibulum. Proin libero nunc consequat interdum. Pharetra
      convallis posuere morbi leo urna molestie at elementum eu.
    </p>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>Contents copyright of Tech Elevator, &copy;, 2021.</p>
  </footer>
</body>
```

## Refactoring with Semantic HTML

Now that you know you have elements with some meaning to them, you can refactor the previous blog post code:

```html
<header>
  <h1>My Blog</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li>one</li>
      <li>two</li>

    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
<section>

</section>
<main>
  <article>

# Intro to CSS

As you saw in the previous section, HTML on its own is functional, but not very stylish. HTML allows you to structure your documents, but **Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS) brings your web pages to life with layout and style. CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.

## Browser default style sheet

Before you learn how to create your own styles, you need to understand that there is some default styling applied to HTML. Imagine you have an HTML document with some headings, paragraphs, a list, and a link:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Basics</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CSS Basics</h1>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Neque tempora
      quasi doloribus labore, reprehenderit iste, aliquid, distinctio
      consectetur ipsum corrupti perferendis? Exercitationem quo dicta
      aspernatur recusandae possimus a cupiditate illum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quam, similique a
      aliquam quidem at nam sapiente nostrum, cum consequuntur enim repellendus
      saepe totam asperiores eaque tempore ipsa exercitationem, delectus
      voluptates.
    </p>

    <h2>Another heading</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>one</li>
      <li>two</li>
      <li>three</li>
    </ul>

    A link to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google.com</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

You'd see a web page that looks like this.

![CSS Default Browser Style Sheet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176081923-9ac90cd5-05db-4d98-83ec-8c57ad2ea3ae.png)

It doesn't look like much, but there are some default styles applied to this HTML:

-   The `<h1>` is larger than the `<h2>`.
-   The `<p>`s have some spacing between them.
-   The `<ul>` has some space between it and the `<h2>`.
-   The link is blue, making it stand out from the rest of the text.

If you open the Chrome Developer Tools and highlight the `<h1>` element, you'll see the style definitions to the right. For `<h1>`, you'll see `user agent stylesheet`, which means this is the default style, and it's coming from the browser.

![User Agent Stylesheet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176081965-39efcc8a-6574-4ff1-9842-ff5987bb9fa7.png)

## CSS documents

Now that you know where the default styles are coming from, you can learn how to create your own style sheets and override them. First, you need to create a new style sheet.

Usually you'd store your style sheets in a directory called `css`. You can call this whatever you want-in this example, it's called `styles.css`. Now, you have a directory structure that looks like this:

```
├── css
│   └── styles.css
└── index.html
```

You need a way to reference your style sheets in your HTML document. You can do this using a new HTML tag, the `<link>` tag. Remember: any metadata about your document or links to style sheets or JavaScript goes in the `<head>` section.

The HTML External Resource Link element, `<link>`, specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to style sheets, but it's also used to establish site icons—both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices—among other things.

Here you can see how to use the `<link>` element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Basics</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
  </head>
</html>
```

## CSS syntax

Now that you linked the HTML document to your style sheet, you can create your styles. The first thing you might want to do is to add comments. Open `styles.css` and add the following:

```css
/* this is a comment */
```

To create a new style, you need to start with a selector. CSS selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply. There are many selectors that you'll learn about later, but for now, you'll learn the most basic one, a type selector.

A type selector selects all elements that have the given tag name. Here are a few examples of type selectors:

```css
body {
  /* apply the following declarations to the body element */
}
h1 {
  /* apply the following declarations to all h1 elements */
}
p {
  /* apply the following declarations to all p elements */
}
```

The style declaration block contains one or more style declarations. Every style declaration consists of two parts: a property and a value. They're separated by a colon and end with a semi-colon:

```css
/* this is a comment */
body {
  /* style declarations */
  /* every style declaration consists of two parts: a property and a value */
  /* seperated by a colon */
  /* ends with a semi-colon */
  property: value;
}
h1 {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  property: value;
}
p {
  property: value;
}
```

# Working with Fonts

One of the first things you might want to do when styling your web page is to change some of the properties related to fonts.

In the previous section, you learned that the browser supplies a default style sheet, and each browser vendor supplies their own. This means that if you're viewing a web page in Chrome on macOS, the default browser font is Times. How can you change that to something else?

You can start by using the `body` selector. The body itself doesn't have any text, but this style applies to the body and each element that's a descendant, or child, of it, which is every element. The property that you'll change is `font-family`, and the value that you'll set it to is `Arial, Helvitica, sans-serif`:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvitica, sans-serif;
}

You might wonder why `font-family` has three values. As you'll learn in the next lesson, there are very few fonts that everyone has universally installed on their machines. What you're declaring here are fallbacks in case the visitor doesn't have the specified font. If they have Arial, their browser uses that. If not, it'll try Helvetica; if that fails, it defaults to a generic sans-serif font.

If you look at this in the browser, you'll see the difference between the default Times and Arial.

>**🛈 Tip: Sans-serif versus serif**
>
>Sans-Serif and Serif are two categories of fonts that you'll come across when building web pages. A serif is a decorative stroke that finishes off the end of a letter's stem, sometimes also called the “feet” of the letters. In turn, a serif font is a font that has serifs, while a sans-serif is a font that doesn't, which is why it's called "sans-serif."

## Web safe fonts

To use a font on a website, that font must exist on a visitor's machine. But what if it isn't? Then the visitor's browser defaults to a font like Times. To avoid this, it's best to use **web safe fonts**. Every device that accesses your website has these fonts, so they're safe to use. Here's a list of web safe fonts:

-   **Serif Fonts**
    -   "Times New Roman", Times, serif
    -   Georgia, serif
    -   "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif
-   **Sans-Serif Fonts**
    -   Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
    -   "Arial Black", Gadget, sans-serif
    -   "Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif
    -   Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif
    -   "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif
    -   Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif
    -   "Trebuchet MS", Helvetica, sans-serif
    -   Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif
-   **Monospace Fonts**
    -   "Courier New", Courier, monospace
    -   "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace

As you can see, this list is small. What happens when you want to diverge from this list?

## Web fonts

There are many web font providers available, with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) being the most popular. Google Fonts allows you to add beautiful typography to your website by including a link to the font's style sheet.

All the fonts in the Google Fonts catalog are free and open source. These fonts use cross-site caching, which means you only need to load a font once with any website. That same cached font can be used on any other website that uses Google Fonts. This means that by the time someone visits your site, there is a good chance they've already loaded your font.

Start by browsing through the Google Fonts catalog until you find one you like and click on it. In this example, you'll use a popular font called [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) .

When you click on the style, you'll see multiple styles you can choose from. Make sure to only select the styles you'll use. Even with caching in place, you'll want to be careful about how many fonts you add to your website. The more fonts you use, the larger your page will be.

A good rule of thumb is to stick to one or two fonts. When you've selected your fonts, you'll see an embed tab on the right side of the page. If you click on it, you'll see some code that you can copy and paste into your style sheet.

Copy the `<link>` tag into your HTML document and place it in the `<head>`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Basics</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
  </head>
</html>
```

Next, update your selector to use the new font family:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```

Now, your page uses the new Roboto web font.

![Roboto Google Font](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176082169-c5e1f1be-c4c9-4092-870b-76494a4669fe.png)

## Font properties

So far, you have only seen one property related to fonts. In this section, you'll learn about some other font properties.

### Font size

The `font-size` property defines the size of the text. This value can be one of any number of units of measurement, which you'll learn about in a later unit. For now, you'll use pixels:

```css
body {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

> The default font-size is 16px, so this is only slightly larger than the default.

### Font weight

The `font-weight` property defines the weight of the text. You can use values like `normal` and `bold` with this property:

-   `font-weight: normal`: The text is normal weight.
-   `font-weight: bold`: The text is bold.

```css
p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

You can also use numerical values:

-   100 Thin
-   200 Extra Light
-   300 Light
-   400 Normal
-   500 Medium
-   600 Semi Bold
-   700 Bold
-   800 Extra Bold
-   900 Ultra Bold

```css
p {
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

> If the font family doesn't provide the requested weight, it uses the closest available one.

### Font style

The `font-style` property specifies the amount of slant the text has:

-   `font-style: normal`: The text isn't slanted.
-   `font-style: italic`: The letters are slightly slanted.
-   `font-style: oblique`: The letters are more slanted than italic.

```
p {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

### Line height

The `line-height` property defines the height of a single line of text:

-   `line-height: normal`: Reverts to the default value of the browser.
-   `line-height: 1.6`: You can use unitless values; the line height is relative to the font size.
-   `line-height: 30px`: You can use pixel values.

### Text align

The `text-align` property defines how the text content of the element is horizontally aligned:

-   `text-align: left`: Align the text content to the left.
-   `text-align: right`: Align the text content to the right.
-   `text-align: center`: Center the text content.
-   `text-align: justify`: Justify the text content.

### Text decoration

The `text-decoration` property defines how to decorate the text content of the element, specifically with an underline or overline:

-   `text-decoration: none`: Removes any text decoration.
-   `text-decoration: underline`: Underlines the text content.

### Text transform

The `text-transform` property defines how to capitalize the text content of the element:

-   `text-transform: none`: Removes any text transformation; the text appears the same as in the HTML code.
-   `text-transform: capitalize`: Turns the first letter of each word into a capital letter.
-   `text-transform: uppercase`: Turns all letters into capital letters.
-   `text-transform: lowercase`: Turns all letters into lowercase letters.

# Working with Colors

If someone handed you the keys to a new car, you'd probably be excited to see it. But that excitement would quickly fade away when you step outside only to see that it's painted a bright, neon green, the carpet is a bright pink, and the car has yellow seat covers. You'd probably ask yourself, "Who designed this car?"

Color matters for the car, and it matters for your website. You must make sure that your designs are visually appealing and that you use color contrast throughout your website. **Color contrast** refers to the difference in light between font, or anything in the foreground, and its background. Try to keep that in mind when changing the colors of backgrounds and fonts.

## Background color

The `background-color` CSS property sets the background color of an element. If you want to change the background color for the entire document, you could target the body element and set the background color to `blue`:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvitica, sans-serif;
  /* we can use names or rgb hex values */
  background-color: blue;
}
```

![Working with Colors - Blue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176082276-8de5e1af-3ab0-4376-ba49-3bf7d0fd04c6.png)

Now that you've changed your background color to blue, the contrast with the black text doesn't look good. It'll be hard for your visitors to read the text on the page. If you want to check the contrast between text and background colors, you can use online tools like the [Coolors Color Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) .

## Color

You know the contrast between the blue background and black text isn't that great, so you need to change the color of the text. The `color` CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text. You can update the text on the page by setting the color property to white using the body selector:

```css
body {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```

![White Text on Blue Background](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176082318-c45b7fb6-bcf3-4458-8561-49985ae4e430.png)

This looks a lot better. Using color contrast in your designs improves the readability of the text on a page.

## Color values

You can now set the background color of any element along with the foreground color of an element's text. In the previous examples, you used names of colors like blue and white, but where did those come from?

There are several ways to define a color. Here are two of the most popular ways:

-   Using a keyword such as blue, white or transparent.
-   Using the RGB cubic-coordinate system through `#-hexadecimal` code.

### Color keywords

Color keywords are case-insensitive identifiers that represent a specific color, such as red, blue, black, or LightSeaGreen. There are several things to keep in mind when using color keywords:

-   CSS completely ignores unknown keywords.
-   The color keywords all represent plain, solid colors, without transparency.
-   Several keywords are aliases for each other:
    -   gray/grey
    -   lightgray/grey
    -   darkgray/darkgrey

Look at this code, which uses an incorrect `verybrightred` value for the `color` property:

```css
body {
  background-color: blue;
  color: verybrightred; /* this keyword is not valid, color reverts back to default of black */
}
```

See the [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) for a full list of color keywords.

### RGB hex

The RGB color model defines a given color according to its red, green, and blue components. If you want to set the background of your document to a `hotpink` color, you could define that using the hexadecimal `#FF0099`. The first two characters represent red, the middle two represent green, and the last two represent blue:

```
body {
  background-color: #ff0099;
}
```

Don't worry about memorizing these numbers. This is something you can lean on your tools to do for you. In Visual Studio Code, you can select a color from the palette, and it inserts the correct hex code for you.

# Quiz

## **Intro to HTML and CSS 1**

**Which of the following are examples of semantic HTML elements?**

	Select all correct options

■ `header`

□ `div`

■ `footer`

■ `main`

□ `span`

■ `form`

■ `table`

**Explanation:** These are all semantic elements because they tell you something about their content. You know that the content of a `footer` element belongs at the bottom of the page, for example, and that a `form` element is for collecting information from the user.


## **Intro to HTML and CSS 2**

**Which example shows usage of an attribute?**

○ `<p>Foo</p>`

○ `font-size: 20px;`

◉ `<input type="text">`

○ `<br />`

**Explanation:** An attribute is a key value pair in an HTML element like `type="text"`.


## **Intro to HTML and CSS 3**

**Which of the following is the correct HTML to create a hyperlink?**

◉ `<a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a>`

○ `<a link="https://www.example.com">Example</a>`

○ `<link href="https://www.example.com">Example</link>`

○ `<a>https://www.example.com</a>`

**Explanation:** The browser displays the anchor element's content, and when the user clicks it, the browser navigates to the URL specified as the value of the `href` attribute.


## **Intro to HTML and CSS 4**

**What CSS property can you use to make text bold?**

○ `strong`

○ `em`

◉ `font-weight`

○ `font-style`

**Explanation:** A CSS declaration of `font-weight: bold` would make the text bold in the elements matched by the selector.


## **Intro to HTML and CSS 5**

**What do the characters in a CSS color hexadecimal string represent—for example, `#402dce`?**

◉ Red, Green, Blue

○ Cyan, Magenta, Yellow

○ Blue, Green, Red

○ Red, Blue, Green

**Explanation:** The first two digits represent the amount of red, the next two digits represent the amount of green, and the last two digits represent the amount of blue. Each pair of digits can range from `00` to `ff`.


## **Intro to HTML and CSS 6**

**True or False: You can specify more than one font in a `font-family` CSS declaration.**

◉ True

○ False

**Explanation:** It's a good idea to specify more than one font in case a user doesn't have the first font in the declaration.


## **Intro to HTML and CSS 7**

**Which of the following forms sends a username and password to an API located at http://localhost:3000/login?**

○ 
```html
<form method="http://localhost:3000/login">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username"/>
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password"/>
</form>
```

◉ 
```html
<form action="http://localhost:3000/login" method="POST">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username"/>
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password"/>
</form>
```

○ 
```html
<form url="http://localhost:3000/login">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username"/>
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password"/>
</form>
```

○ 
```html
<form url="http://localhost:3000/login" method="POST">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username"/>
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password"/>
</form>
```

**Explanation:** The `action` attribute of a form is where the browser sends the data. The `method` attribute tells the form to send the content in a POST request.


## **Intro to HTML and CSS 8**

**Which element is normally the parent of the `title` element?**

○ `html`

◉ `head`

○ `body`

○ `header`

**Explanation:** The `title` element is metadata that belongs in `head`. It sets the text that appears in the tab of your browser window.


## **Intro to HTML and CSS 9**

**Which semantic HTML element represents a stand-alone document within a page?**

○ `header`

◉ `article`

○ `footer`

○ `aside`

**Explanation:** `article` represents a stand-alone document within a page. For instance, a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry are all examples of stand-alone documents within a page.


## **Intro to HTML and CSS 10**

**Which of the following includes a style sheet named `styles.css` located in a directory named `css`?**

○ `<a link="css/styles.css">Stylesheet</a>`

○ `<a href="css/styles.css">Stylesheet</a>`

○ `<link href="stylesheet" rel="css/styles.css"/>`

◉ `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"/>`

**Explanation:** You use the `link` element with the attribute `href` specifying the location of the style sheet.
