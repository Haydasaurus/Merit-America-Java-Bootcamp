# Logical Branching

## Boolean expressions

As you already know, boolean expressions evaluate to `true` or `false`. There are two common ways that boolean expressions are built:

-   Comparison operators (to compare two values)
-   Logical operators (to create relationships between one or more boolean values)

### Comparison operators

In addition to the relational operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) matching those in Java and C#, JavaScript has four equality operators:

| **Operator** | **Meaning**           |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| `==`         | Equal To              |
| `===`        | Strictly equal to     |
| `!=`           | Not Equal To          |
| `!==`        | Strictly not equal to |

The equality (`==`) and inequality (`!=`) operators attempt to convert operands of different types before comparing them, while the strict versions require values to be the same type to be considered equal:

```js
5 == 5;  // true
5 == '5'; // true
5 === 5; // true
5 === '5'; // false
```

### Logical operators

The logical operators are AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`). These operators are used with boolean values to create boolean expressions the same way they're used in Java or C#.

## Conditional code

JavaScript includes an `if` statement for logical branching that works the same way an `if` statement does in Java or C#:

```js
if (condition) {

} else if (condition) {

} else {

}
```

The condition specified for the `if` may be a boolean expression or any other truthy or falsy value:

```js
if (100) {
    // The code here will be executed because 100 is a truthy value.
}
```

## Blocks and scope

JavaScript handles blocks and scope mostly the same way that Java and C# do:

```js
{ //outer block
    let i;
    { //inner block
        let j;
    }
}
```

The variable `j` has the scope of the inner block. Statements within the inner block can use both `i` and `j`. Statements in the outer block can only use `i`.

One difference from Java and C# is that JavaScript allows a variable in an inner block to have the same name as a variable in an outer block. These are then two separate variables:

```js
{
    let i = 3;
    {
        let i = 29;  // <-- This is a new variable
        console.log(i);  // <-- Will print 29
    }
    console.log(i); // <-- Back to the original variable, will print 3
}
```

This overlapping of variables is called **shadowing**. The inner scope variable "shadows" the outer scope.
