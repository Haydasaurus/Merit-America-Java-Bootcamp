# Operators and Arithmetic

JavaScript provides `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` arithmetic operators, like Java and C#.

Also like Java and C#, the order of the operators isn't always from left to right. You can see the full table of [operator precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence) on the Mozilla Developer Network.

## Shorthand assignment operators

Closely associated with basic arithmetic are the shorthand assignments operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`). You've seen these in Java and C#, and they work the same way in JavaScript.
