# Loops

## `for` loops

The JavaScript `for` loop has the same syntax as a `for` loop in Java or C#:

```js
for (initializer; condition; iterator) {
    //body
}
```

Here's an example `for` loop:

```js
let sum = 0; // the sum of all our scores

for(let i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + testScores[i];  // add each score to the sum
}

const average = sum / testScores.length;
```

## `for...of` loops

The JavaScript equivalent to a Java or C# foreach loop is a `for...of` loop:

```js
for (variable of iterable) {
    //body
}
```

Here's an example:

```js
let sum = 0;

for (const score of testScores) {
    sum += score;
}

const average = sum / testScores.length;
```

## `while` and `do...while` loops

JavaScript also has the same syntax as Java and C# for `while` and `do...while` loops:

```js
while (condition) {
    //body (which never runs if condition is false or a falsy value)
}

do {
    //body (which always runs at least once)
} while (condition);
```
