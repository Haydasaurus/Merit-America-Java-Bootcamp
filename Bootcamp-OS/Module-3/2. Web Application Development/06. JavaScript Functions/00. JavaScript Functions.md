# JavaScript Functions

JavaScript functions are similar to **_methods_** found in languages such as Java and C#. Like methods, functions are callable blocks of code surrounded by curly braces. Also, like methods, functions can accept parameters and return values.

Unlike methods in Java or C#, JavaScript functions aren't limited to classes. They can appear virtually anywhere within code. Additionally, while Java and C# methods can be used to avoid duplicate code and enable code reuse, they serve primarily as the **_behavior_** half in the **_state-behavior_** of classes.

JavaScript functions, on the other hand, are essentially about code reuse and avoiding duplication and are only incidentally used in the occasional class in JavaScript.

# Named Functions

Before you learn about functions, it's important that you understand the two parts of a named function: the **function signature** and the **function body**.

The components of a function signature are:

-   The function name
-   The function parameters

![Function signature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176940226-cc008d41-9d4a-4f09-96f4-180235962530.png)

## Function name

Like variables, functions have names that can be used to reference them. Also, like variable names, careful consideration should be given to choosing names for functions. Function names should be:

-   **descriptive** - it should be clear what type of action or calculation the function performs when invoked
-   **camelCase** - the first letter of the name is lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase
-   **unique** - function names need to be unique across all JavaScript code that's loaded into the page. If a name conflicts with another function, the one that's loaded last overwrites the other one

## Function parameters

Parameters are variables that can provide input values to a function. When functions are created, parameter lists indicate what inputs the function can accept.

For example, consider the following function:

```js
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
  let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

  return result;
}
```

This method indicates that it accepts two parameters. The first parameter acts as the multiplicand and the second, the multiplier.

You can then call that function using its name and passing in parameters.

```js
console.log(multiplyBy(5, 2));
```

The function takes the two arguments, multiplies them together, and then **return**s the result. The `return` keyword is used here to return the value that's in the `result` variable back to whoever called the function. So `10` is printed to the console.

There are more things to talk about with parameters in JavaScript, including the lack of required parameters, default values in parameters, and how to deal with an unknown number of parameters.

## Optional parameters

Parameters in JavaScript are always optional. So what if a value isn't provided for a parameter when calling a function? As mentioned in the previous unit, if you don't assign a value to a variable, the variable is set to `undefined`.

Look at this function, for example:

```js
console.log(multiplyBy());
```

You can call this function, but it prints `NaN` to the console. This is because its two parameters are getting no value, and `undefined` multiplied by `undefined` returns the value `NaN`, which stands for **Not a Number**.

## Default parameter values

In some cases, there's a reasonable default value that you can use if a parameter value isn't supplied. For example, in the case of the `multiplyBy` function, perhaps you want `multiplicand` and `multiplier` to default to `0` if a value isn't supplied. To do that, you'll rewrite the function to look like this:

```js
function multiplyBy(multiplicand = 0, multiplier = 0) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

Now, if a parameter is missing, it's set to `0` instead of `undefined`.

Imagine that you called `multiplyBy` again:

```js
console.log(multiplyBy(2));
```

It now prints `0` to the console instead of `NaN`. You can use this to make your functions more robust and useful in varying scenarios.

This is especially useful because JavaScript doesn't have overloaded functions like C# or Java does. If you want a function to take a different number of parameters, you have to write all of that logic in the same function. Optional parameters make your code more flexible and able to handle different situations.

## Handling an unknown number of parameters

There may be times when you want to handle an unknown number of parameters. A good example of this is writing a function that concatenates an unknown number of strings together. If you call a function like this:

```js
let name = concatAll(firstName, lastName);
```

You might also want to call it like this:

```js
let name = concatAll(honorific, firstName, mothersMaidenName, '-', fathersLastName);
```

The issue here is that there's no way to know how many parameters you have for that function. But in JavaScript, you can use a special variable to get at all of the given parameters, whether you expect them or not. This variable is called `arguments`.

With `arguments`, you can treat all parameters that have been passed to the function as an array, even if you don't have any parameters defined in the actual function definition.

So you could implement the `concatAll()` function like so:

```js
function concatAll() { // No parameters defined, but we still might get some
    let result = '';
    for(let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
        result += arguments[i];
    }
    return result;
}
```

Given that function definition, `concatAll("Good", "Bad", "Ugly")` returns `"GoodBadUgly"`.

# Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are functions that don't have a name. You can use functions in JavaScript like any other value, so creating a function without a name is possible. You create an anonymous function with the following syntax:

![Arrow function signature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176940755-4b713f44-9387-43a9-bd13-ad08e6df9e0c.png)

Looking at the image, this function has no name and can't be called as is. You can either assign it to a variable to call it:

```js
let multiply = (multiplicand, multiplier) => {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}

console.log( multiply(5, 2) ); // Prints `10` to the console
```

Alternatively, you can pass the anonymous function to another function:

```js
// Filter an array of numbers so that we are only left with even numbers
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

let evenNumbers = numbers.filter( (number) => {
    return number % 2 === 0;
});

console.log( evenNumbers ); // Prints out `[2, 4]`
```

In the previous code example, a new anonymous function is created and passed as a parameter to [the `filter` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter#Description) on the `numbers` array.

Now, you don't need to fully understand how this works but you do need to know that you can do it. If a function is just a block of code, then you can put the block of code in a variable and pass it around in your program.

This makes anonymous functions very powerful, and as a consequence, widely used in JavaScript applications.

## Array functions using anonymous functions

Arrays in JavaScript have many useful functions themselves that use anonymous functions.

### `forEach`

`forEach` is a function that should look familiar to you. It performs like a `for` loop, running a passed in anonymous function for every element of an array:

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

numbers.forEach( (number) => {
    console.log(`This number is ${number}`);
});
```

### `map`

`map` is like `forEach`, but it returns a new array using the return value of the anonymous function as the values in the new array:

```js
let numbersToSquare = [1, 2, 3, 4];

let squaredNumbers = numbersToSquare.map( (number) => {
    return number * number;
});

console.log(squaredNumbers);
```

### `filter`

`filter` takes an anonymous function, runs each element through it, and returns a new array. If the function returns `true`, the element is kept in the new array. If the function returns `false`, the element is dropped from the new array:

```js
let numbersToFilter = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

let filteredNumbers = numbersToFilter.filter( (number) => {
    // Only keep numbers divisible by 3
    return number % 3 === 0;
});

console.log(filteredNumbers);
```

### `reduce`

`reduce` collapses the array down to one single value using the logic of the anonymous function. Here, the anonymous function gets two parameters: the current single value containing the result of all previous elements—typically called the reducer—and the next element to add to that value:

```js
let nameParts = ['bosco', 'p.', 'soultrain'];

let fullName = nameParts.reduce( (reducer, part) => {
    return reducer + ' ' + part.substring(0, 1).toLocaleUpperCase() + part.substring(1);
}, ''); // <--- The empty quotes is the value of the reducer for the first element

console.log(fullName.trim());
```

# Documenting JavaScript

One of the core responsibilities of a programmer is writing documentation for the code they create. This includes functions.

### Function comments

Comments on functions are typically detected by the development environment and are used to create documentation of your code for other programmers to use. They follow a standard format called [JSDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc) , and Visual Studio Code helps you write them.

First, you document the function:

![Documenting multiplyBy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176942787-c13e9b72-1ed3-4364-8420-a18f2ddfa137.gif)

When you need to call the function elsewhere in your code, this comment shows up in IntelliSense.

![Showing IntelliSense](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176942820-06f50497-e8fc-41fe-8561-462ba05a2d02.gif)

JSDoc is so powerful and helpful that it's a good idea to write it for any function that you write in JavaScript from now on.

#### Writing JSDoc

Writing JSDoc consists of a few key steps. Feel free to follow along in Visual Studio Code with the example below.

First, write a function like you normally would. Having the function signature in place helps Visual Studio Code fill in a lot of the JSDoc for you.

```js
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

Then, in the line right before the `function`, type `/**` and press enter.

```js
/**
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

That expands into this:

```js
/**
 *
 * @param multiplicand
 * @param multiplier
 */
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

The `@param` lines that appeared mean that they're specific comments for your parameters. They're listed on their own lines and in the order that your parameters are listed in your function. Now, all of your parameters are ready to be documented.

Your cursor starts after the first parameter. Type in what that parameter is. When you're done, go to the next parameter and add documentation for that as well:

```js
/**
 *
 * @param multiplicand a number to multiply
 * @param multiplier a number to multiply by
 */
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

You can then describe what the function does in the space before the parameters. This is where you list out what the function is for, any assumptions that you're making on the parameters coming in, and what value the function returns.

```js
/**
 * Takes two numbers and returns the product of
 * those two numbers.
 *
 * Will return NaN if exactly two numbers are not
 * given.
 *
 * @param multiplicand a number to multiply
 * @param multiplier a number to multiply by
 */
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

You could be done here, but there are a few more things you can add. First, under the `@param` lines, add another line that uses `@returns` to describe the return value:

```js
/**
 * Takes two numbers and returns the product of
 * those two numbers.
 *
 * Will return NaN if exactly two numbers are not
 * given.
 *
 * @param multiplicand a number to multiply
 * @param multiplier a number to multiply by
 * @returns product of the two parameters
 */
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

You can also describe the data types of the parameters and return value. In JavaScript, you can't enforce that your function is getting the correct data types, but you can clearly say what types you expect in these comments. This way, other programmers know that their code may not work correctly if they provide a different type.

You can add those to `@param` and `@returns` by adding data types after those keywords in curly brackets.

```js
/**
 * Takes two numbers and returns the product of
 * those two numbers.
 *
 * Will return NaN if exactly two numbers are not
 * given.
 *
 * @param {number} multiplicand a number to multiply
 * @param {number} multiplier a number to multiply by
 * @returns {number} product of the two parameters
 */
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

That's all you need to do. Visual Studio Code instantly picks up these comments and uses them as documentation in the IntelliSense system.

# Quiz

## **JavaScript Functions 1**

**Given the following function definition:**

```js
function divideTwo(a, b) {
    return a / b;
}
```

What would be the result of `divideTwo(10, 2)`?

○ `2`

◉ `5`

○ `10`

○ `20`

○ `NaN`

**Explanation:** The parameter `a` has the value `10` and the parameter `b` has the value `2`. The expression `10 / 2` evaluates to `5` which is the value that's returned.


## **JavaScript Functions 2**

**Parameters in JavaScript functions are always optional.**

◉ True

○ False

**Explanation:** Any parameters not specified receive the value `undefined`.


## **JavaScript Functions 3**

**Select each of the letters where `name` would be in scope if you added a line of code there:**

```js
let ages = [14, 12, 16];
// a.
ages.forEach( (age) => {
    // b.
    let name = 'Little Johnny';
    // c.
    console.log(`${name} is ${age} years old.`);
    // d.
});
// e.
```

	Select all correct options

□ a

□ b

■ c

■ d

□ e

**Explanation:** A variable declared with `let` is in scope from that point to the end of the block.


## **JavaScript Functions 4**

**Select each of the letters where `word` would be in scope if you added a line of code there:**

```js
let sentences = paragraph.split('.');

sentences.forEach( (sentence) => {
    // a.
    sentence.split(' ').forEach( (word) => {
        // b.
        console.log(word);
    });
    // c.

    console.log("Finished a sentence.");
    // d.
});
// e.
```

	Select all correct options

□ a

■ b

□ c

□ d

□ e

**Explanation:** A parameter for an anonymous function is only in scope within the body of that function.


## **JavaScript Functions 5**

**Given the following function definition:**

```js
function add( a = 0, b = 0 ) {
    return a + b;
}
```

**What would be the result of calling `add(2)`?**

○ `0`

◉ `2`

○ `4`

○ `NaN`

○ causes an error

**Explanation:** The parameter `a` has the value `2` and the parameter `b` has the value `0`. The expression `2 + 0` evaluates to `2` which is the value that's returned.


## **JavaScript Functions 6**

**Arrange the JSDoc lines in the order they would normally appear to document this function:**

```js
function countLargeNumbers(numbers, threshold) {
    return numbers.reduce((count, num) => {
        return count + (num > threshold? 1 : 0);
     }, 0);
}
```

▤ `/**`

▤ `* Counts how many numbers in an array are greater than a specified threshold.`

▤ `* @param {Array} numbers - values to consider`

▤ `* @param {number} threshold - values greater than this are "large"`

▤ `* @returns {number} count of large numbers`

▤ `*/`

**Explanation:** JSDoc normally describes the function, then its parameters, and then its return value.


## **JavaScript Functions 7**

**Anonymous functions are functions that:**

○ Can't be called more than once

○ Can't ever be called like a named function

◉ Don't have names when first created

○ Don't have parameters

**Explanation:** You define an anonymous function without a name. You can then pass it to another function or give it a name.


## **JavaScript Functions 8**

**What would be the value of `filteredArray` after running the following code:**

```js
let theArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
let filteredArray = theArray.filter( (element) => { return element % 2 === 0; } );
```

○ `[2]`

○ `[4]`

◉ `[2, 4, 6, 8]`

○ `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`

○ `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

**Explanation:** The expression `element % 2 === 0` evaluates to `true` when `element` is an even number, and the `filter()` method returns an array containing the elements for which the function passed to it returns `true`.
