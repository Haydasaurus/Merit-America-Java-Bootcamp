# JavaScript Functions

JavaScript functions are similar to **_methods_** found in languages such as Java and C#. Like methods, functions are callable blocks of code surrounded by curly braces. Also, like methods, functions can accept parameters and return values.

Unlike methods in Java or C#, JavaScript functions aren't limited to classes. They can appear virtually anywhere within code. Additionally, while Java and C# methods can be used to avoid duplicate code and enable code reuse, they serve primarily as the **_behavior_** half in the **_state-behavior_** of classes.

JavaScript functions, on the other hand, are essentially about code reuse and avoiding duplication and are only incidentally used in the occasional class in JavaScript.
