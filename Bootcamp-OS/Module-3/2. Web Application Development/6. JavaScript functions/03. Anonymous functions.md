# Anonymous functions

Anonymous functions are functions that don't have a name. You can use functions in JavaScript like any other value, so creating a function without a name is possible. You create an anonymous function with the following syntax:

![Arrow function signature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176940755-4b713f44-9387-43a9-bd13-ad08e6df9e0c.png)

Looking at the image, this function has no name and can't be called as is. You can either assign it to a variable to call it:

```js
let multiply = (multiplicand, multiplier) => {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}

console.log( multiply(5, 2) ); // Prints `10` to the console
```

Alternatively, you can pass the anonymous function to another function:

```js
// Filter an array of numbers so that we are only left with even numbers
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

let evenNumbers = numbers.filter( (number) => {
    return number % 2 === 0;
});

console.log( evenNumbers ); // Prints out `[2, 4]`
```

In the previous code example, a new anonymous function is created and passed as a parameter to [the `filter` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter#Description) on the `numbers` array.

Now, you don't need to fully understand how this works but you do need to know that you can do it. If a function is just a block of code, then you can put the block of code in a variable and pass it around in your program.

This makes anonymous functions very powerful, and as a consequence, widely used in JavaScript applications.

## Array functions using anonymous functions

Arrays in JavaScript have many useful functions themselves that use anonymous functions.

### `forEach`

`forEach` is a function that should look familiar to you. It performs like a `for` loop, running a passed in anonymous function for every element of an array:

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

numbers.forEach( (number) => {
    console.log(`This number is ${number}`);
});
```

### `map`

`map` is like `forEach`, but it returns a new array using the return value of the anonymous function as the values in the new array:

```js
let numbersToSquare = [1, 2, 3, 4];

let squaredNumbers = numbersToSquare.map( (number) => {
    return number * number;
});

console.log(squaredNumbers);
```

### `filter`

`filter` takes an anonymous function, runs each element through it, and returns a new array. If the function returns `true`, the element is kept in the new array. If the function returns `false`, the element is dropped from the new array:

```js
let numbersToFilter = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

let filteredNumbers = numbersToFilter.filter( (number) => {
    // Only keep numbers divisible by 3
    return number % 3 === 0;
});

console.log(filteredNumbers);
```

### `reduce`

`reduce` collapses the array down to one single value using the logic of the anonymous function. Here, the anonymous function gets two parameters: the current single value containing the result of all previous elements—typically called the reducer—and the next element to add to that value:

```js
let nameParts = ['bosco', 'p.', 'soultrain'];

let fullName = nameParts.reduce( (reducer, part) => {
    return reducer + ' ' + part.substring(0, 1).toLocaleUpperCase() + part.substring(1);
}, ''); // <--- The empty quotes is the value of the reducer for the first element

console.log(fullName.trim());
```
