# Documenting JavaScript

One of the core responsibilities of a programmer is writing documentation for the code they create. This includes functions.

### Function comments

Comments on functions are typically detected by the development environment and are used to create documentation of your code for other programmers to use. They follow a standard format called [JSDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc) , and Visual Studio Code helps you write them.

First, you document the function:

![Documenting multiplyBy](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/dfa474d12bc5ab28a3c52119d9657bfd.gif)

When you need to call the function elsewhere in your code, this comment shows up in IntelliSense.

JSDoc is so powerful and helpful that it's a good idea to write it for any function that you write in JavaScript from now on.

#### Writing JSDoc

Writing JSDoc consists of a few key steps. Feel free to follow along in Visual Studio Code with the example below.

First, write a function like you normally would. Having the function signature in place helps Visual Studio Code fill in a lot of the JSDoc for you.

```js
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

Then, in the line right before the `function`, type `/**` and press enter.

```js
/**
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

That expands into this:

```js
/**
 *
 * @param multiplicand
 * @param multiplier
 */
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

The `@param` lines that appeared mean that they're specific comments for your parameters. They're listed on their own lines and in the order that your parameters are listed in your function. Now, all of your parameters are ready to be documented.

Your cursor starts after the first parameter. Type in what that parameter is. When you're done, go to the next parameter and add documentation for that as well:

```js
/**
 *
 * @param multiplicand a number to multiply
 * @param multiplier a number to multiply by
 */
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

You can then describe what the function does in the space before the parameters. This is where you list out what the function is for, any assumptions that you're making on the parameters coming in, and what value the function returns.

```js
/**
 * Takes two numbers and returns the product of
 * those two numbers.
 *
 * Will return NaN if exactly two numbers are not
 * given.
 *
 * @param multiplicand a number to multiply
 * @param multiplier a number to multiply by
 */
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

You could be done here, but there are a few more things you can add. First, under the `@param` lines, add another line that uses `@returns` to describe the return value:

```js
/**
 * Takes two numbers and returns the product of
 * those two numbers.
 *
 * Will return NaN if exactly two numbers are not
 * given.
 *
 * @param multiplicand a number to multiply
 * @param multiplier a number to multiply by
 * @returns product of the two parameters
 */
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

You can also describe the data types of the parameters and return value. In JavaScript, you can't enforce that your function is getting the correct data types, but you can clearly say what types you expect in these comments. This way, other programmers know that their code may not work correctly if they provide a different type.

You can add those to `@param` and `@returns` by adding data types after those keywords in curly brackets.

```js
/**
 * Takes two numbers and returns the product of
 * those two numbers.
 *
 * Will return NaN if exactly two numbers are not
 * given.
 *
 * @param {number} multiplicand a number to multiply
 * @param {number} multiplier a number to multiply by
 * @returns {number} product of the two parameters
 */
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

That's all you need to do. Visual Studio Code instantly picks up these comments and uses them as documentation in the IntelliSense system.
