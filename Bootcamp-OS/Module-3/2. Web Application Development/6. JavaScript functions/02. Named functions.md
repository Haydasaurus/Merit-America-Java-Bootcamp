# Named functions

Before you learn about functions, it's important that you understand the two parts of a named function: the **function signature** and the **function body**.

The components of a function signature are:

-   The function name
-   The function parameters

## Function name

Like variables, functions have names that can be used to reference them. Also, like variable names, careful consideration should be given to choosing names for functions. Function names should be:

-   **descriptive** - it should be clear what type of action or calculation the function performs when invoked
-   **camelCase** - the first letter of the name is lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase
-   **unique** - function names need to be unique across all JavaScript code that's loaded into the page. If a name conflicts with another function, the one that's loaded last overwrites the other one

## Function parameters

Parameters are variables that can provide input values to a function. When functions are created, parameter lists indicate what inputs the function can accept.

For example, consider the following function:

```js
function multiplyBy(multiplicand, multiplier) {
  let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

  return result;
}
```

This method indicates that it accepts two parameters. The first parameter acts as the multiplicand and the second, the multiplier.

You can then call that function using its name and passing in parameters.

```js
console.log(multiplyBy(5, 2));
```

The function takes the two arguments, multiplies them together, and then **return**s the result. The `return` keyword is used here to return the value that's in the `result` variable back to whoever called the function. So `10` is printed to the console.

There are more things to talk about with parameters in JavaScript, including the lack of required parameters, default values in parameters, and how to deal with an unknown number of parameters.

## Optional parameters

Parameters in JavaScript are always optional. So what if a value isn't provided for a parameter when calling a function? As mentioned in the previous unit, if you don't assign a value to a variable, the variable is set to `undefined`.

Look at this function, for example:

```js
console.log(multiplyBy());
```

You can call this function, but it prints `NaN` to the console. This is because its two parameters are getting no value, and `undefined` multiplied by `undefined` returns the value `NaN`, which stands for **Not a Number**.

## Default parameter values

In some cases, there's a reasonable default value that you can use if a parameter value isn't supplied. For example, in the case of the `multiplyBy` function, perhaps you want `multiplicand` and `multiplier` to default to `0` if a value isn't supplied. To do that, you'll rewrite the function to look like this:

```js
function multiplyBy(multiplicand = 0, multiplier = 0) {
    let result = multiplicand * multiplier;

    return result;
}
```

Now, if a parameter is missing, it's set to `0` instead of `undefined`.

Imagine that you called `multiplyBy` again:

```js
console.log(multiplyBy(2));
```

It now prints `0` to the console instead of `NaN`. You can use this to make your functions more robust and useful in varying scenarios.

This is especially useful because JavaScript doesn't have overloaded functions like C# or Java does. If you want a function to take a different number of parameters, you have to write all of that logic in the same function. Optional parameters make your code more flexible and able to handle different situations.

## Handling an unknown number of parameters

There may be times when you want to handle an unknown number of parameters. A good example of this is writing a function that concatenates an unknown number of strings together. If you call a function like this:

```js
let name = concatAll(firstName, lastName);
```

You might also want to call it like this:

```js
let name = concatAll(honorific, firstName, mothersMaidenName, '-', fathersLastName);
```

The issue here is that there's no way to know how many parameters you have for that function. But in JavaScript, you can use a special variable to get at all of the given parameters, whether you expect them or not. This variable is called `arguments`.

With `arguments`, you can treat all parameters that have been passed to the function as an array, even if you don't have any parameters defined in the actual function definition.

So you could implement the `concatAll()` function like so:

```js
function concatAll() { // No parameters defined, but we still might get some
    let result = '';
    for(let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
        result += arguments[i];
    }
    return result;
}
```

Given that function definition, `concatAll("Good", "Bad", "Ugly")` returns `"GoodBadUgly"`.
