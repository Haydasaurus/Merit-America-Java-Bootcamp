# CSS Grid layout

Grid is a fairly recent addition to CSS, but it's already adopted by more than 95% of browsers in use today. **Grid** provides the ability to split an HTML page into rows and columns and then assign elements of that page into the "grid" that's created.

Grid is typically used to split up the major sections of a page—like a header, footer, nav, and main content—and then assign elements to those sections. The browser then calculates and figures out how everything fits and how big it all must be.

In these examples, you'll look at using the most powerful feature of Grid for designing layouts: grid template areas.

## Defining the grid

Imagine there is a page with the following HTML body:

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  </header>
  <aside>This is the sidebar</aside>
  <main>
    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>This is our main content.</p>
  </main>
  <footer>Copyright 2021 by Me</footer>
</body>
```

By default, using the normal flow of the document, it looks like this:

![Default HTML](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/dee0c340c13b2322a72bc4a079e8ed84.png)

Depending on the project you're working on, this layout may be fine. But what happens if you want more control over placement of the elements? For example, what if you want your content laid out in four columns?

You can create this layout with grid. To define a grid, you use the `grid` value of the `display` property. Any element can be a grid container.

When you set `display: grid`, all of the direct children of the container become grid items:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
}
```

## Grid template columns

The `body` is now a grid container, which by default gives you a one-column grid, as the first image shows. To customize the layout of the grid, you need to define the number and size of each column.

To define the columns in your grid, you can use the property `grid-template-columns`. The value of this property is the number of columns you want to define and the size of the column.

In the following example, you're defining a grid with four columns where the first and third columns are `200px` wide, and the second and fourth columns are `100px` wide:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 100px 200px 100px;
}
```

This approach works, but you're using pixels here, which are fixed-length units. What if you want your grid to have four equally sized columns and span 100% of the available width?

In addition to creating grids using the units of measure that you already know, grid introduces the `fr` unit to flexibly size grid rows and columns. This unit represents one **_fraction_** of the available space in the grid container. To have four equally sized columns, you can update your `grid-template-columns` to this:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
```

After making these changes, the page looks like this:

![HTML page with Grid](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/df9df71de5d82a5138fefffb27cef8b1.png)

The content is now laid out horizontally rather than vertically. If you want to see the grid lines, you can use Chrome's Developer Tools. Open the inspector and select any element that's a grid container and you'll see the grid outline in the browser:

## Gap

You might also want some space between the grid items. You can do this by adding padding or margins to your elements, but it's better to add some space between the columns and rows instead. You can do this by adding the `gap` property to your grid definition:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 40px;
}
```

This adds some buffer between the cells of the grid:

You can see that it doesn't affect any content that spans across the grid but separates the different grid items from the others.

## Grid template rows

In the previous example, you only had four elements distributed across four columns. The layouts you create in CSS Grid consist of both columns and rows. What happens if you have more elements than columns?

In this next example, you have twelve boxes that you need to display across four columns:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box">1</div>
  <div class="box">2</div>
  <div class="box">3</div>
  <div class="box">4</div>
  <div class="box">5</div>
  <div class="box">6</div>
  <div class="box">7</div>
  <div class="box">8</div>
  <div class="box">9</div>
  <div class="box">10</div>
  <div class="box">11</div>
  <div class="box">12</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

If you run this example, the layout looks like this:

![Implicit Rows](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/37a0234edeb187beb4c31a5d9759078c.png)

So far you've only specified columns, and yet Grid creates rows to hold your content. This is an example of explicit versus implicit grid. You explicitly defined how many columns you wanted along with their size, and then grid implicitly determined that you needed three `grid-template-rows` to create this layout. By default, automatically created rows in the grid are auto-sized, which means the rows are large enough to fit their content.

What if you wanted to be more explicit with your row definitions?

For example, say that you want the first and third row to be `100px` in height and the second row to take up the rest of the available space. You can also use both `px` and `fr` units here and be explicit about how you want your rows defined:

```css
.container {
  height: 500px;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 1fr 100px;
  gap: 20px;
}
```
