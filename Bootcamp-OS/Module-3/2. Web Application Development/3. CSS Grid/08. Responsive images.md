# Responsive images

When working with images, if the `width` property isn't set or is set to a fixed pixel width, then the image may break the fluid layout as the browser tries to render the image at its full size.

In the following example, there are three large images, all with a width of 1920px, in a grid container that defines three equal columns:

```html
<div class="container">
  <img src="img/bird.jpg" />
  <img src="img/flower.jpg" />
  <img src="img/porch.jpg" />
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

If you don't specify a width on the image, the grid expands to fit each of the grid items. This means that the images run far off the right side of the screen, which isn't a good experience for your users.

You could set a fixed width of `200px` on the images, but this doesn't scale up or down. If your visitor has a large monitor, you want them to view these images at their full scale. If they're on a mobile device, you want to resize them down accordingly.

Instead, you can set the width to a percentage that it needs to take up and indicate that the height can scale automatically:

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

As the user resizes the browser, the container that holds the image changes the size and immediately scales the image accordingly.

If you run this example, you'll see the images scale to the size of the container:
