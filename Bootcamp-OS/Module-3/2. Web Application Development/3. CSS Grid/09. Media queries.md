# Media queries

Even when you design with fluid layouts and responsive images, it may still be necessary to render a completely different layout when there are screen size limitations. For example, refer again to the different layouts of Medium website:

![Medium.com Responsive Layout](https://bootcamp-os-lms-prd-public.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/488af95a5ad1a1251282acb5f9927940.png)

On the smallest screen, the layout is a single-column layout where each element is stacked vertically. Article images are placed on the right and marketing images are hidden because they're non-essential. To accommodate this, CSS allows you to write conditional CSS in the form of **media queries**.

A media query is a special CSS rule that specifies when to apply other CSS rules. Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site depending on conditions like the user's viewport width.

Media queries start with the keyword `@media`, then the condition or conditions on which to apply the CSS rules.

Here's an example of a media query:

```css
body {
  grid-template-columns: 5fr 3fr 2fr;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
  img {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

In this example, if the viewport width is **_768px or less_**, the rules under `max-width: 768px` apply, so the grid container is one column instead of three, and images aren't displayed.

>ðŸ›ˆ Note: what does "only screen" mean?
>
>The `only screen` condition of the media query is commonly used. This condition means that the media query only applies to devices with a screen, like desktops, phones, and tablets.

Another common media query type is `print` that's used for printed material or viewing a page in "print preview" mode.

You can also specify rules that apply to a specific viewport width and larger:

```css
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  body {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}
```

In this example, if the viewport width is **_768px or larger_**, the rules under `min-width: 768px` apply, so the font size is increased to 24px.

For responsive designs, you'll typically only use `min-width` or `max-width`, but there are other settings like `orientation` and `aspect-ratio`. A full reference is available on [MDN Web Docs - Using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) .

## Breakpoints

When you design a site to be responsive, you'll likely end up with media queries for different viewport sizes. These different widths are often called **breakpoints**.

Since it'd be difficult to have a breakpoint for every single device that exists, it's normal to define breakpoints using a variety of ranges that accommodate smartphones, tablets, desktop, and extra-large screens.

You can use these common breakpoints as a reference:

```css
/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  ...
}

/* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  ...
}

/* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  ...
}

/* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {
  ...
}

/* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
  ...
}
```

## Setting the viewport

To use media queries on a mobile device, you need to instruct the browser how you want it to treat the viewport.

The **viewport** is the area of your web browser where you see content. When you load a non-mobile optimized site on a mobile device, the browser tries to fit everything on it's narrow screen. To accomplish that, it "pretends" it has a larger viewport, then shrinks down the content so the user can see everything at once.

This was initially done because many sites weren't designed for mobile screens, and sites might look bad if the browser tried to load it without shrinking.

However, as sites become mobile-optimzed, there needed to be a way to prevent this shrinking.

By including this tag in your HTML `<head>`, you instruct the browser how you want it to treat the viewport:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

In this example, `width=device-width` sets the width of the page to use the actual screen width of the device, not the "pretend" width. `initial-scale=1.0` sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

There are other less common properties and values that you can use, but typically the ones shown in the example are enough.

## Mobile first

With the shift in internet consumption coming from mobile devices, mobile screens are now the primary means in which users interact with your applications. As such, the term **mobile-first** was coined to indicate that applications should be developed with a "mobile-first mindset."

As developers, instead of adding breakpoints into the design as the width of the screen gets smaller, it's best to create breakpoints in the design when the width of the screen gets larger.

One approach that helps provide a mobile-first approach is to [simulate mobile devices](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/) using Chrome or Firefox's Responsive Web Design tools.

A strategy to follow for introducing breakpoints is to start with the small screen first, then expand until it looks bad. At this point, it's time to insert a new breakpoint.
