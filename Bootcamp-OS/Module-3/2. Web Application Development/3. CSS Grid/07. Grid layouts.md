# Grid layouts

You've started to learn how to use grids in CSS. Responsive sites use grids to fit different screen sizes. A 3-column layout shouldn't specify dimensions as pixels but rather as proportions in relation to the other columns. For instance, Column 1 takes up half the page, Column 2 takes up 30%, and Column 3 takes up the remaining 20%.

Take a look at these example screenshots from the NASA website:

Looking at the different layouts, you might be able to notice the grid being used in each but it's not the same grid layout for all three. The smallest size is one column wide, while the middle size is mostly two columns with the top row spanning both columns. The largest size is a 4-column layout, although most rows have a cell that spans two columns. Each layout isn't defined by pixels, but by percentages.

You'll learn how to define different CSS rules for different layouts later in this unit.
