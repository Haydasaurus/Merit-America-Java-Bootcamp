# Responsive web design

In the early days of web development, sites were designed for a particular screen size. You might've seen a page that had a message like "This page is best viewed at 800 x 600." Even though there were only two or three widely used resolutions at the time, it's pretty unreasonable to ask the user to change their resolution to view your website.

Today, there are many different screen sizes and resolutions when you take into account all of the desktop displays, laptops, tablets, and phones. So how do you create a website that renders well on any screen size?

This began a concept called **responsive web design**. Responsive web design is a set of practices that allows pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen sizes and resolutions. The goal of responsive design is to create one site that works on every screen.

For example, look at the following images of the Medium website. As the screen size changes, the layout changes as well to best make use of the available space:

## Designing a responsive interface

Applying a responsive design consists of addressing three key areas:

1.  Flexible, or fluid, grid layouts
2.  Resizable images
3.  CSS media queries

Whether a visitor to your site uses a phone or a large screen desktop, your site must automatically switch to accommodate the screen's resolution and support larger image sizes. Even if the user doesn't switch devices, but changes the orientation of the screen from portrait to landscape, you want your design to accommodate the extra space and fill it with content accordingly.
