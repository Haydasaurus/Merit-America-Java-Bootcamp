# JavaScript Event Handling

When users interact with a web page, whether that's by scrolling, moving their mouse over elements, or clicking on forms or buttons, you can create certain JavaScript logic to respond to those events. In JavaScript, this is called **Event Handling**.

Built into the browser is a system that constantly notifies and processes events that are happening while the page loads. This includes browser events, like the DOM being successfully loaded or state changes in the display of the page, and user events, like mouse clicks or key presses.

This system is open enough that you can write JavaScript to listen for certain events and have your logic run as well when things happen. You can also write JavaScript that triggers certain events to mimic browser activity, or create your own custom events to add more capability to your application.
