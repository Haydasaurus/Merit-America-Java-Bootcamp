# Listening for Events in JavaScript

Reacting to events in JavaScript requires three things:

1.  A DOM element that you want to listen to events on
2.  A specific event that you want to listen to
3.  A function that holds the logic that you want to execute

You already know how to select DOM elements. But how do you know what events you can listen for on a certain element?

## Types of events

All DOM elements can receive the following events:

-   `click` - a user has clicked on the DOM element
-   `dblclick` - a user has double-clicked on the DOM element
-   `mouseover` - a user has moved their mouse over the DOM element
-   `mouseout` - a user has moved their mouse out of the DOM element

Input elements, like `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>`, also trigger these events:

-   `keydown` - a user pressed down a key (including shift, alt, etc.) while on this DOM element
-   `keyup` - a user released a key (including shift, alt, etc.) while on this DOM element
-   `change` - a user has finished changing the value of this input element
-   `focus` - a user has selected this input element for editing
-   `blur` - a user has unselected this input element for editing

Form elements have these events:

-   `submit` - a user has submitted this form using a submit button or by hitting Enter on a text input element
-   `reset` - a user has reset this form using a reset button

There are many more events that you can listen for, but these are the ones you'll use most of the time. You can find more at the [MDN documentation for events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) .

## Adding event handlers to DOM elements

Imagine that you want to react to a user clicking on a button. When they click the button, you'll change the text in an `<h1>` to be different. The HTML for this might look something like this:

```html
<h1 id="greeting">Hello</h1>
<button id="change-greeting">Change Greeting</button>
```

First, you'd write a JavaScript function that does all the logic:

```js
function changeGreeting() {
    let greetingHeader = document.getElementById('greeting');
    greetingHeader.innerText = 'Goodbye';
}
```

Now, you want to get the DOM element you want to listen to the event on. You can get a reference to the button like this:

```js
let changeButton = document.getElementById('change-greeting');
```

Then you attach the function to run whenever there's a click event on the button:

```js
changeButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    changeGreeting();
});
```

That's the basics of event handling.

## Event handling using anonymous functions

You could also get the same capability by attaching an anonymous function as the event listener instead of calling a named function:

```js
changeButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    let greetingHeader = document.getElementById('greeting');
    greetingHeader.innerText = 'Goodbye';
});
```

These two examples are functionally the same, but you might have reasons to use one over the other.

>ðŸ›ˆ Note: Best practices and Tech Elevator convention
>
You'll see in all of the examples that event listeners are always structured as two different functions. You're encouraged you to follow this convention too.
>
The structure is that you first write your named function that implements the event handler logic:
>
>```js
>function changeGreeting() {
>    let greetingHeader = document.getElementById('greeting');
>    greetingHeader.innerText = 'Goodbye';
>}
>```
>
>And then call that in an event listener:
>
>```js
>let changeButton = document.getElementById('change-greeting');
>changeButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
>    changeGreeting();
>});
>```
>
>This is a best practice for several reasons. First, you can test the event handler as it's a normal JavaScript function. Secondly, it makes the code more flexible and able to handle HTML structure changes in the future.

## The event object

All event handlers receive an object when the event is triggered called the **Event Object**. This object holds many important properties that you can use to get information about what the event was.

To use this object, you can write your event handlers to take a parameter that holds the event object:

```js
(event) => {
    ...
}
```

In the function, you have access to an object that has details of the event that was triggered, including:

| **Property**                       | **Found In**              | **Purpose**                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| currentTarget                      | All events                | Holds the element that the event listener was registered on                                                                              |
| clientX                            | Mouse events              | The X coordinate on the screen of the click                                                                                              |
| clientY                            | Mouse events              | The Y coordinate on the screen of the click                                                                                              |
| altKey, metaKey, ctrlKey, shiftKey | Mouse and Keyboard events | A boolean on whether the specified key was pressed down during the event                                                                 |
| key                                | Keyboard events           | The key that was pressed, taking the Shift key into account. Arrow keys show up as 'ArrowRight', 'ArrowDown', 'ArrowLeft', and 'ArrowUp' |
