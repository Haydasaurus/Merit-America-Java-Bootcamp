## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 1**

**CSS Grid allows you to create:**

○ a one-dimensional layout with elements in rows

◉ a two-dimensional layout with elements in rows and columns

○ a three-dimensional layout with elements in rows, columns, and stacks

**Explanation:** As the name implies, a CSS Grid consists of columns and rows.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 2**

**You can place an element can in a grid area called "content" by applying which declaration to it?**

○ `grid-template-area: content;`

○ `grid-template: "content";`

○ `grid-name: "content";`

◉ `grid-area: content;`

**Explanation:** This declaration places the element in the grid area called "content" assuming "content" is one of the area names listed in the `grid-templates-areas:` declaration. For instance: `grid-templates-areas: "lefthand content righthand";`.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 3**

**The property used to define the columns for a grid is:**

◉ `grid-template-columns`

○ `grid-template-rows`

○ `grid-columns`

○ `grid-column`

**Explanation:** `grid-template-columns` specifies the number (and widths) of columns in a grid layout.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 4**

**In this definition:**

```css
grid-template-areas: "header . nav";
```

**What does the `.` represent?**

○ repeat the header section

○ the grid begins a new row

◉ the area is empty of content

○ there's a class of `nav` on the element

**Explanation:** `header` and `nav` are the names of grid areas specified with a `grid-area` rule. `.` signifies an empty grid cell.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 5**

**Given the following HTML and CSS, which answer lists all the grid items?**

```html
<section id="world-wide">
  <h2>World Wide</h2>
  <article>
     <section>
        <div></div>
     </section>
     <section>
       <div></div>
     </section>
  </article>
</section>

<section>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
</section>
```

```css
section {
   display: grid;
}
```

○ `h2`, `article`

○ `h2`, `article`, `article > section` elements, all `div` elements, all `p` elements

○ All the `section` elements

◉ `h2`, `article`, all `p`, all `div` elements

**Explanation:** Every element except the `section` elements is a direct child of a `section`, which is a grid container. So every element except the `section` elements is a **_grid item_**.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 6**

**True or False: To center an element both vertically and horizontally within a grid cell, use `align-items: center` and `justify-items: center`.**

◉ True

○ False

**Explanation:** You center an element vertically with `align-items: center` and horizontally with `justify-items: center`.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 7**

**You need to conditionally apply styles to a viewport with a width no wider than 768px. What's the correct use of the `@media` CSS rule?**

○ `@media only screen and (width: 768px) {...}`

◉ `@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {...}`

○ `@media only screen and (width: < 768px) {...}`

○ `@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}`

**Explanation:** `max-width` is the correct condition to check for screens no wider than `768px`.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 8**

**Given the following media queries with the established breakpoints shown, at what screen sizes would a browser apply at least one of these styles?**

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  /* styles here */
}
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* styles here */
}
```

○ only screens between `600px` and `768px` wide

○ only screens less than `600px` wide

◉ only screens greater than `600px` wide

○ only screens greater than `768px` wide

**Explanation:** The conditions specified by both media queries would be true for screens greater than `600px`.
