# Layouts in CSS

Layouts for HTML pages were once handled by the HTML side of web pages. At first, most of the layout was done using HTML tables and splitting the content up into different cells on the page.

Eventually, the trend moved toward handling layout by using `<div>`s and then positioning those `<div>`s properly on the page using float, alignment, and position. Then CSS libraries like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) came along to try and fix the layout issues in CSS. These became very popular and solved the issue as best they could.

But now there are better tools for handling layouts than ever before in CSS, supported by more and more browsers as they improve. The two main tools that you'll learn about are **Flexbox** and **Grid**. Both of these are rather new additions to CSS but are already adopted by all the major browsers.

The Flexible Box Module, or Flexbox, helps align and layout **_items_**. Flexbox is useful for any interface layout that needs to nicely organize a group of similar objects, like a Twitter feed, a list of products on Amazon, or a Pinterest board.

The CSS Grid Layout, or Grid, allows dividing a **_page_** into major regions and then assigning elements to those regions. This removes the need for floats, trying to align elements, or writing extra CSS and HTML to lay the elements out properly. It also makes responding to screen size changes—from desktop to phone to tablet—easier.

Using Flexbox and Grid together can build very complex and stable layouts very quickly. You'll look at Grid first, since that's mainly used for laying out entire pages, and then Flexbox, which can lay out sections of a page.

# CSS Grid Layout

Grid is a fairly recent addition to CSS, but it's already adopted by more than 95% of browsers in use today. **Grid** provides the ability to split an HTML page into rows and columns and then assign elements of that page into the "grid" that's created.

Grid is typically used to split up the major sections of a page—like a header, footer, nav, and main content—and then assign elements to those sections. The browser then calculates and figures out how everything fits and how big it all must be.

In these examples, you'll look at using the most powerful feature of Grid for designing layouts: grid template areas.

## Defining the grid

Imagine there is a page with the following HTML body:

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  </header>
  <aside>This is the sidebar</aside>
  <main>
    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>This is our main content.</p>
  </main>
  <footer>Copyright 2021 by Me</footer>
</body>
```

By default, using the normal flow of the document, it looks like this:

![Default HTML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176824294-74cf8da8-ee4a-456b-b7ee-d5d8a5058363.png)

Depending on the project you're working on, this layout may be fine. But what happens if you want more control over placement of the elements? For example, what if you want your content laid out in four columns?

![HTML page with Grid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176824349-f43ad15d-75c1-4887-b8d4-6124cf18f5df.png)

You can create this layout with grid. To define a grid, you use the `grid` value of the `display` property. Any element can be a grid container.

When you set `display: grid`, all of the direct children of the container become grid items:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
}
```

## Grid template columns

The `body` is now a grid container, which by default gives you a one-column grid, as the first image shows. To customize the layout of the grid, you need to define the number and size of each column.

To define the columns in your grid, you can use the property `grid-template-columns`. The value of this property is the number of columns you want to define and the size of the column.

In the following example, you're defining a grid with four columns where the first and third columns are `200px` wide, and the second and fourth columns are `100px` wide:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 100px 200px 100px;
}
```

This approach works, but you're using pixels here, which are fixed-length units. What if you want your grid to have four equally sized columns and span 100% of the available width?

In addition to creating grids using the units of measure that you already know, grid introduces the `fr` unit to flexibly size grid rows and columns. This unit represents one **_fraction_** of the available space in the grid container. To have four equally sized columns, you can update your `grid-template-columns` to this:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
```

After making these changes, the page looks like this:

![HTML page with Grid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176824349-f43ad15d-75c1-4887-b8d4-6124cf18f5df.png)

The content is now laid out horizontally rather than vertically. If you want to see the grid lines, you can use Chrome's Developer Tools. Open the inspector and select any element that's a grid container and you'll see the grid outline in the browser:

![Chrome Dev Tools with Grid outlined](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176824429-d27f5229-e0a3-4088-80ab-ee270122f984.png)

## Gap

You might also want some space between the grid items. You can do this by adding padding or margins to your elements, but it's better to add some space between the columns and rows instead. You can do this by adding the `gap` property to your grid definition:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 40px;
}
```

This adds some buffer between the cells of the grid:

![HTML with gap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176824589-f2902e2a-b213-4fb3-8f54-484369267407.png)

You can see that it doesn't affect any content that spans across the grid but separates the different grid items from the others.

## Grid template rows

In the previous example, you only had four elements distributed across four columns. The layouts you create in CSS Grid consist of both columns and rows. What happens if you have more elements than columns?

In this next example, you have twelve boxes that you need to display across four columns:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box">1</div>
  <div class="box">2</div>
  <div class="box">3</div>
  <div class="box">4</div>
  <div class="box">5</div>
  <div class="box">6</div>
  <div class="box">7</div>
  <div class="box">8</div>
  <div class="box">9</div>
  <div class="box">10</div>
  <div class="box">11</div>
  <div class="box">12</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

If you run this example, the layout looks like this:

![Implicit Rows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176824612-1479cefa-7bee-498a-b224-3d85e8a1a819.png)

So far you've only specified columns, and yet Grid creates rows to hold your content. This is an example of explicit versus implicit grid. You explicitly defined how many columns you wanted along with their size, and then grid implicitly determined that you needed three `grid-template-rows` to create this layout. By default, automatically created rows in the grid are auto-sized, which means the rows are large enough to fit their content.

What if you wanted to be more explicit with your row definitions?

For example, say that you want the first and third row to be `100px` in height and the second row to take up the rest of the available space. You can also use both `px` and `fr` units here and be explicit about how you want your rows defined:

```css
.container {
  height: 500px;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 1fr 100px;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

![Explicit Grid Template Rows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176824641-3c3b444a-8aee-42d7-b128-31c234278f24.png)

# CSS Units: Viewport

In the previous example, you defined the container as `500px` in height. In this scenario, you know that the middle row is `300px` because the container has a fixed height. What if you want the container to stretch the entire height of the viewport?

There are two CSS units of measure that allow you to do this:

-   `vh`: Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
-   `vw`: Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport

You can use `vh` to set the height of the container. In this example, you define the height as `100vh` to set the container's height to be 100% of the viewport. Using `vh` and the `fr` unit, you can define three rows that evenly stretch the entire height of the screen:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

![CSS unit vh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176824725-15e59044-224d-4790-9ecb-19a663e18a55.png)

# Box Alignment

Until now, the grid items took up all of the available space. But this won't always be the case, and when it isn't, you need a way to align grid items in your layout. When working with grid layouts, there are two axes you can align items against: the block axis (column) and the inline (row) axis.

![Block Alignment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176824928-2f6b0467-e572-4a15-8130-f3341c41d8f0.png)

You define these properties on the grid container to specify how to align all of the grid items:

-   `align-items`: Aligns grid items along the block (column) axis
-   `justify-items`: Aligns grid items along the inline (row) axis

## Column alignment

The property `align-items` controls the alignment on the block axis (column). There are many different values you can use with `align-items`, and you can view them on the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items) . Here are the most common ones:

-   `stretch`: Fills the whole height of the cell (default)
-   `start`: Aligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell
-   `end`: Aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell
-   `center`: Aligns items in the center of their cell

In the following example, there are twelve boxes, and the following images show the different values for `align-items`:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box">1</div>
  <div class="box">2</div>
  <div class="box">3</div>
  <div class="box">4</div>
  <div class="box">5</div>
  <div class="box">6</div>
  <div class="box">7</div>
  <div class="box">8</div>
  <div class="box">9</div>
  <div class="box">10</div>
  <div class="box">11</div>
  <div class="box">12</div>
</div>
```

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
  align-items: stretch; /* this is the default */
}

.box {
  padding: 40px;
  background-color: rgb(111, 158, 202);
}
```

`align-items: stretch`: This is the default value, and because it's also the default value for `justify-items` (row), the content stretches to fill the available space on both axes:

![Align Items Stretch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176824968-ed54bd0b-37b2-47f6-a8f3-f0f49bdd921f.png)

`align-items: start` ![Align Items Start](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176825477-ace40b31-085e-47be-9ae8-0bc53c427827.png)

`align-items: center` ![Align Items Center](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176825510-384cf2f4-7f5d-44e0-85b0-677d0774e12f.png)

`align-items: end` ![Align Items End](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176825569-e7fded87-01a8-4567-a93d-e11167194a2b.png)

## Row alignment

The property `justify-items` controls the alignment on the inline axis (row). There are many different values you can use with `justify-items`, and you can view them on the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-items) . Here are the most common ones:

-   `stretch`: Fills the whole height of the cell (default)
-   `start`: Aligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell
-   `end`: Aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell
-   `center`: Aligns items in the center of their cell

In the following example, there are twelve boxes, and the following images show the different values for `justify-items`:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box">1</div>
  <div class="box">2</div>
  <div class="box">3</div>
  <div class="box">4</div>
  <div class="box">5</div>
  <div class="box">6</div>
  <div class="box">7</div>
  <div class="box">8</div>
  <div class="box">9</div>
  <div class="box">10</div>
  <div class="box">11</div>
  <div class="box">12</div>
</div>
```

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
  justify-items: stretch; /* this is the default */
}

.box {
  padding: 40px;
  background-color: rgb(111, 158, 202);
}
```

`justify-items: stretch`: This is the default value, and because it's also the default value for `align-items` (column), the content stretches to fill the available space on both axes.

![Justify Items: Stretch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176825806-89a4b4b9-63b7-4777-a16c-2d7b3446f028.png)

## Column and row alignment

There are times when you need to center an item on both axes. You can do this by setting `align-items: center` and `justify-items: center`:

```css
.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
  align-items: center;
  justify-items: center;
}
```

![Center Center](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176825954-46bd8586-4566-47d0-8249-f3f25cd0a036.png)

# Grid Template Areas

In this section, you'll learn about a new grid property called `grid-templates-areas`.

Until now, you've assumed that every item in the grid takes up a single cell. There are times when you'll need a grid item to span multiple columns, rows, or both. Look at this first example:

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  </header>
  <aside>This is the sidebar</aside>
  <main>
    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>This is our main content.</p>
  </main>
  <footer>Copyright 2021 by Me</footer>
</body>
```

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr
}
```

You know that this CSS places the content in four evenly spaced columns that results in this layout:

![HTML page with Grid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827074-d5051ccf-881c-4af0-a222-9d5924742d2a.png)

With grid template areas, you define a grid of rows and columns to split your page up into, and then assign elements from your HTML into those grid areas. Using the same markup from before, you can create a grid that looks like this:

![Grid Template Areas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827095-85dce8fe-ab53-4560-a4b9-a3f65da9e272.svg)

You define the template in CSS, defining grid areas and naming them so that you can insert your content into them. First, you define the `grid-template-areas` property and set it to a string template. Each string is a row in your grid and each word is a column in that row, as shown below:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header header"
    "content content . sidebar"
    "footer footer footer footer";
}
```

If you define the same name to each column in a row, that means that element spans that entire row. If you put a `.` in one of the areas, that means that the area is empty.

You then have to assign these grid names to your elements that are in the `body` element:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header header"
    "content content . sidebar"
    "footer footer footer footer";
}

main {
  grid-area: content;
}

header {
  grid-area: header;
}

footer {
  grid-area: footer;
}

aside {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
```

Now you can see your page laid out within this template:

![HTML page with laid out Grid elements](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827120-d4193e1c-f3e6-46c0-9c5e-2d19442ecc09.png)

# Responsive Web Design

In the early days of web development, sites were designed for a particular screen size. You might've seen a page that had a message like "This page is best viewed at 800 x 600." Even though there were only two or three widely used resolutions at the time, it's pretty unreasonable to ask the user to change their resolution to view your website.

Today, there are many different screen sizes and resolutions when you take into account all of the desktop displays, laptops, tablets, and phones. So how do you create a website that renders well on any screen size?

This began a concept called **responsive web design**. Responsive web design is a set of practices that allows pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen sizes and resolutions. The goal of responsive design is to create one site that works on every screen.

For example, look at the following images of the Medium website. As the screen size changes, the layout changes as well to best make use of the available space:

![Medium.com - obtained via https://mediaqueri.es](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827195-aaac4726-1ea4-48a2-8780-ca0ed066f7f1.png)

Visit [https://mediaqueri.es](https://mediaqueri.es) to see a gallery of common websites and how they render their pages responsively.

## Designing a responsive interface

Applying a responsive design consists of addressing three key areas:

1.  Flexible, or fluid, grid layouts
2.  Resizable images
3.  CSS media queries

Whether a visitor to your site uses a phone or a large screen desktop, your site must automatically switch to accommodate the screen's resolution and support larger image sizes. Even if the user doesn't switch devices, but changes the orientation of the screen from portrait to landscape, you want your design to accommodate the extra space and fill it with content accordingly.

# Grid Layouts

You've started to learn how to use grids in CSS. Responsive sites use grids to fit different screen sizes. A 3-column layout shouldn't specify dimensions as pixels but rather as proportions in relation to the other columns. For instance, Column 1 takes up half the page, Column 2 takes up 30%, and Column 3 takes up the remaining 20%.

Take a look at these example screenshots from the NASA website:

![NASA website](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827284-f1f8c76f-3e86-4a62-9449-d0bd6b479223.png)

Looking at the different layouts, you might be able to notice the grid being used in each but it's not the same grid layout for all three. The smallest size is one column wide, while the middle size is mostly two columns with the top row spanning both columns. The largest size is a 4-column layout, although most rows have a cell that spans two columns. Each layout isn't defined by pixels, but by percentages.

You'll learn how to define different CSS rules for different layouts later in this unit.

---

# Responsive Images

When working with images, if the `width` property isn't set or is set to a fixed pixel width, then the image may break the fluid layout as the browser tries to render the image at its full size.

In the following example, there are three large images, all with a width of 1920px, in a grid container that defines three equal columns:

```html
<div class="container">
  <img src="img/bird.jpg" />
  <img src="img/flower.jpg" />
  <img src="img/porch.jpg" />
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

If you don't specify a width on the image, the grid expands to fit each of the grid items. This means that the images run far off the right side of the screen, which isn't a good experience for your users.

You could set a fixed width of `200px` on the images, but this doesn't scale up or down. If your visitor has a large monitor, you want them to view these images at their full scale. If they're on a mobile device, you want to resize them down accordingly.

Instead, you can set the width to a percentage that it needs to take up and indicate that the height can scale automatically:

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

As the user resizes the browser, the container that holds the image changes the size and immediately scales the image accordingly.

If you run this example, you'll see the images scale to the size of the container:

![Responsive images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827388-fea24260-4661-4ed0-aaf6-3256bff88d22.gif)


---

# Media Queries

Even when you design with fluid layouts and responsive images, it may still be necessary to render a completely different layout when there are screen size limitations. For example, refer again to the different layouts of Medium website:

![Medium com Responsive Layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/176827473-e7f0ada1-d510-42d3-a2d2-c1570eb6a858.png)

On the smallest screen, the layout is a single-column layout where each element is stacked vertically. Article images are placed on the right and marketing images are hidden because they're non-essential. To accommodate this, CSS allows you to write conditional CSS in the form of **media queries**.

A media query is a special CSS rule that specifies when to apply other CSS rules. Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site depending on conditions like the user's viewport width.

Media queries start with the keyword `@media`, then the condition or conditions on which to apply the CSS rules.

Here's an example of a media query:

```css
body {
  grid-template-columns: 5fr 3fr 2fr;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
  img {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

In this example, if the viewport width is **_768px or less_**, the rules under `max-width: 768px` apply, so the grid container is one column instead of three, and images aren't displayed.

>**🛈 Note: what does "only screen" mean?**
>
>The `only screen` condition of the media query is commonly used. This condition means that the media query only applies to devices with a screen, like desktops, phones, and tablets.

Another common media query type is `print` that's used for printed material or viewing a page in "print preview" mode.

You can also specify rules that apply to a specific viewport width and larger:

```css
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  body {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}
```

In this example, if the viewport width is **_768px or larger_**, the rules under `min-width: 768px` apply, so the font size is increased to 24px.

For responsive designs, you'll typically only use `min-width` or `max-width`, but there are other settings like `orientation` and `aspect-ratio`. A full reference is available on [MDN Web Docs - Using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) .

## Breakpoints

When you design a site to be responsive, you'll likely end up with media queries for different viewport sizes. These different widths are often called **breakpoints**.

Since it'd be difficult to have a breakpoint for every single device that exists, it's normal to define breakpoints using a variety of ranges that accommodate smartphones, tablets, desktop, and extra-large screens.

You can use these common breakpoints as a reference:

```css
/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  ...
}

/* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  ...
}

/* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  ...
}

/* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {

## Setting the viewport

To use media queries on a mobile device, you need to instruct the browser how you want it to treat the viewport.

The **viewport** is the area of your web browser where you see content. When you load a non-mobile optimized site on a mobile device, the browser tries to fit everything on it's narrow screen. To accomplish that, it "pretends" it has a larger viewport, then shrinks down the content so the user can see everything at once.

This was initially done because many sites weren't designed for mobile screens, and sites might look bad if the browser tried to load it without shrinking.

However, as sites become mobile-optimzed, there needed to be a way to prevent this shrinking.

By including this tag in your HTML `<head>`, you instruct the browser how you want it to treat the viewport:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

In this example, `width=device-width` sets the width of the page to use the actual screen width of the device, not the "pretend" width. `initial-scale=1.0` sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

There are other less common properties and values that you can use, but typically the ones shown in the example are enough.

## Mobile first

With the shift in internet consumption coming from mobile devices, mobile screens are now the primary means in which users interact with your applications. As such, the term **mobile-first** was coined to indicate that applications should be developed with a "mobile-first mindset."

As developers, instead of adding breakpoints into the design as the width of the screen gets smaller, it's best to create breakpoints in the design when the width of the screen gets larger.

One approach that helps provide a mobile-first approach is to [simulate mobile devices](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/) using Chrome or Firefox's Responsive Web Design tools.

A strategy to follow for introducing breakpoints is to start with the small screen first, then expand until it looks bad. At this point, it's time to insert a new breakpoint.

# Unit Summary

In this unit, you learned about using CSS Grid to layout your HTML page, including how to:

-   Define the grid container using `display: grid`.
-   Use `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` to define the layout of a grid.
-   Align grid elements both horizontally and vertically.
-   Define complex layouts using `grid-template-areas`.
-   The basics of responsive web design, including using media queries.

# Quiz

## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 1**

**CSS Grid allows you to create:**

○ a one-dimensional layout with elements in rows

◉ a two-dimensional layout with elements in rows and columns

○ a three-dimensional layout with elements in rows, columns, and stacks

**Explanation:** As the name implies, a CSS Grid consists of columns and rows.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 2**

**You can place an element can in a grid area called "content" by applying which declaration to it?**

○ `grid-template-area: content;`

○ `grid-template: "content";`

○ `grid-name: "content";`

◉ `grid-area: content;`

**Explanation:** This declaration places the element in the grid area called "content" assuming "content" is one of the area names listed in the `grid-templates-areas:` declaration. For instance: `grid-templates-areas: "lefthand content righthand";`.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 3**

**The property used to define the columns for a grid is:**

◉ `grid-template-columns`

○ `grid-template-rows`

○ `grid-columns`

○ `grid-column`

**Explanation:** `grid-template-columns` specifies the number (and widths) of columns in a grid layout.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 4**

**In this definition:**

```css
grid-template-areas: "header . nav";
```

**What does the `.` represent?**

○ repeat the header section

○ the grid begins a new row

◉ the area is empty of content

○ there's a class of `nav` on the element

**Explanation:** `header` and `nav` are the names of grid areas specified with a `grid-area` rule. `.` signifies an empty grid cell.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 5**

**Given the following HTML and CSS, which answer lists all the grid items?**

```html
<section id="world-wide">
  <h2>World Wide</h2>
  <article>
     <section>
        <div></div>
     </section>
     <section>
       <div></div>
     </section>
  </article>
</section>

<section>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
</section>
```

```css
section {
   display: grid;
}
```

○ `h2`, `article`

○ `h2`, `article`, `article > section` elements, all `div` elements, all `p` elements

○ All the `section` elements

◉ `h2`, `article`, all `p`, all `div` elements

**Explanation:** Every element except the `section` elements is a direct child of a `section`, which is a grid container. So every element except the `section` elements is a **_grid item_**.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 6**

**True or False: To center an element both vertically and horizontally within a grid cell, use `align-items: center` and `justify-items: center`.**

◉ True

○ False

**Explanation:** You center an element vertically with `align-items: center` and horizontally with `justify-items: center`.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 7**

**You need to conditionally apply styles to a viewport with a width no wider than 768px. What's the correct use of the `@media` CSS rule?**

○ `@media only screen and (width: 768px) {...}`

◉ `@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {...}`

○ `@media only screen and (width: < 768px) {...}`

○ `@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}`

**Explanation:** `max-width` is the correct condition to check for screens no wider than `768px`.


## **CSS Grid & Responsive Design 8**

**Given the following media queries with the established breakpoints shown, at what screen sizes would a browser apply at least one of these styles?**

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  /* styles here */
}
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* styles here */
}
```

○ only screens between `600px` and `768px` wide

○ only screens less than `600px` wide

◉ only screens greater than `600px` wide

○ only screens greater than `768px` wide

**Explanation:** The conditions specified by both media queries would be true for screens greater than `600px`.
