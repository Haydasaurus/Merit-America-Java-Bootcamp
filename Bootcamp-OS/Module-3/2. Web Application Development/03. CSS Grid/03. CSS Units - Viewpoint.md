# CSS Units: Viewport

In the previous example, you defined the container as `500px` in height. In this scenario, you know that the middle row is `300px` because the container has a fixed height. What if you want the container to stretch the entire height of the viewport?

There are two CSS units of measure that allow you to do this:

-   `vh`: Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
-   `vw`: Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport

You can use `vh` to set the height of the container. In this example, you define the height as `100vh` to set the container's height to be 100% of the viewport. Using `vh` and the `fr` unit, you can define three rows that evenly stretch the entire height of the screen:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}
```
