# Running JavaScript

While JavaScript is run in many contexts these days, the original, and still the most common way to run JavaScript, is in a web browser. One of the core components of a modern web browser is a **JavaScript engine**, which is a program that executes JavaScript code.

You use the `<script>` HTML element to embed JavaScript into a web page so it's run by the browser.

JavaScript code can be included directly within the `<script>` element, like this:

```js
<script>
    const message = 'Hello browser!';
    console.log(message);
</script>
```

Or, JavaScript code in a separate file can be loaded like this:

```js
<script src="my-amazing-script.js"></script>
```
