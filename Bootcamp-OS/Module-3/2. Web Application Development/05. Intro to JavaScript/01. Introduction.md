# Introduction

JavaScript is a general-purpose programming language originally intended as a way to bring dynamic behavior to the static content of HTML. JavaScript has evolved considerably from its earliest days and is now used in ways not thought of back in the mid-1990s. From the beginning, JavaScript was designed to be a quickly learned, forgiving language that was approachable for beginners.

Quickly adopted by the European community and standardized under the name, "ECMAScript", JavaScript has migrated beyond its traditional place in the browser. Now, you can find JavaScript in backend applications using NodeJS, embedded in innumerable IoT projects around the world, and used as a sort of universal "glue" which binds together applications with bits and pieces of code.
