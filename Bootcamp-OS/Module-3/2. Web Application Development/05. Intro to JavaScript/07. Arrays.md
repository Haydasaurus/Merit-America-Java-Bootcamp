# Arrays

## Declaring and initializing an array

Here's the syntax for declaring and initializing a new empty array:

```js
const testScores = [];
```

If you know the values of your array, you can provide those values at the time of initialization:

```js
const testScores = [ 85, 96, 80, 98, 89, 70, 93, 84, 66, 96 ];
```

## Accessing elements within an array

You access a particular element in an array or assign to it a new value the same way you would in Java or C#:

```js
    const testScores = [ 85, 96, 80, 98, 89, 70, 93, 84, 66, 96 ];

    testScores[0] = 82; // update the value at index 0 to 82
    testScores[1] = 72; // update the value at index 1 to 72
    testScores[4] = 80; // update the value at index 4 to 80

    const highScore = testScores[3]; //set highScore to 98
```

## Determining the length of an array

Each array has a property, `.length`, that allows you to retrieve the size of the given array:

```js
    const size = testScores.length;
```

As in Java or C#, that property is often used in conjunction with `for` loops (discussed later in this unit) and when referencing the last value:

```js
const testScores = [90, 85, 70, 55, 70, 75, 95, 100];

const lastValue = testScores[testScores.length - 1];
const secondToLastValue = testScores[testScores.length - 2];
```

## Useful array functions

JavaScript arrays have many useful built-in functions. You can find documentation on them at [the MDN site on Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) .

### `push()`

The `push()` function adds a new element to the end of an array:

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4);
// numbers is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### `unshift()`

The `unshift()` function adds a new element to the beginning of an array:

```js
let numbers = [2, 3, 4];
numbers.unshift(1);
// numbers is now [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

### `pop()`

The `pop()` function is related to the `push()` function. `pop()` removes an element from the end of the array. It also returns the element that was removed:

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let removedElement = numbers.pop();
// numbers now is [1, 2, 3];
// removedElement is 4;
```

### `shift()`

The `shift()` function is related to the `unshift()` function. `shift()` removes an element from the beginning of the array. It also returns the element that was removed:

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let removedElement = numbers.shift();
// numbers now is [2, 3, 4];
// removedElement is 1;
```

### `includes()`

The `includes()` function checks if a given value is in an array. It won't tell you how many times it's in the array, but it does return `true` if it found the value at all or `false` if it isn't found:

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let foundThree = numbers.includes(3); // foundThree will be true
let foundFour = numbers.includes(4); // foundFour will be false
```

### `indexOf()`

The `indexOf()` function finds the location of a value in an array. It finds the first instance of the value and then returns the index to that element. If it can't find the value, it returns `-1`:

```js
let numbers = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'three', 'five', 'three'];
let indexOfThree = numbers.indexOf('three'); // indexOfThree will be 2, the index of the first 'three'
let indexOfSix = numbers.indexOf('six'); // indexOfSix will be -1
```

### `lastIndexOf()`

The `lastIndexOf()` function finds the last location of a value in an array. It finds the last instance of a value and then returns the index to that element. If it can't find the value, it returns `-1`:

```js
let numbers = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'three', 'five', 'three'];
let indexOfThree = numbers.lastIndexOf('three'); // indexOfThree will be 6, the index of the last 'three'
let indexOfSix = numbers.lastIndexOf('six'); // indexOfSix will be -1
```

### `join()`

The `join()` function accepts an array and returns a string, putting a value in between every element. The array itself doesn't change:

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let joinedNumbers = numbers.join(';');
// joinedNumbers is "1;2;3"
```

### `reverse()`

The `reverse()` function reverses the array, making the first element the last and the last element first, and reversing everything in between too. It reverses the array in place, changing the original:

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.reverse();
// numbers is [3, 2, 1];
```
