# Methods

When you need an object to "do something" or perform a behavior, you can use methods.

In the case of the clock, it can _tick_. When you invoke the tick method, it changes the state of the class by ticking forward one second at a time.

The following code sample shows how to add a `tick()` method that changes the state of the object:

```java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    // tick() method changes the value of hour, minute, and second
    // void means nothing is returned
    public void tick() {
        this.second += 1;

        if (this.second >= 60) {
            this.minute += 1;
            this.second = 0;
        }

        if (this.minute >= 60) {
            this.hour += 1;
            this.minute = 0;
        }

        if (this.hour >= 24) {
            this.hour = 0;
        }
    }

    public String getCurrentTime() {
        return String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", this.hour, this.minute, this.second);
    }

    public void setHour(int hour) {
        this.hour = hour;
    }

    public void setMinute(int minute) {
        this.minute = minute;
    }

    public void setSecond(int second) {
        this.second = second;
    }

    public int getHour() {
        return this.hour;
    }

    public int getMinute() {
        return this.minute;
    }

    public int getSecond() {
        return this.second;
    }
}
```

```java
// Program.java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Clock grandfather = new Clock();

    // Set the time to 12:22:32
    grandfather.setHour(12);
    grandfather.setMinute(22);
    grandfather.setSecond(32);

    grandfather.tick(); // time will be 12:22:33
    grandfather.tick(); // time will be 12:22:34

    // Prints "Current time is 12:22:34
    System.out.println("Current time is " + grandfather.getCurrentTime());
}
```

## Tip: Encapsulate logic with methods
Using methods allows you to **encapsulate** the logic needed to make your clock function. By encapsulating the internal mechanisms of the class, the user of your class has to interact with it in a predictable way.

Rather than having the user of the clock change the second, minute, and hour manually, the clock ticks and internally manages the values, incrementing by one or rolling over to zero. Ideally, this limits the risk of bugs that appear in your code.

## Parts of a method
A method consists of several parts:

-   An access modifier
-   A return type
-   A method name
-   A parameter list
-   An exception list
-   A method body

The return type and method name are the only two required. The rest are optional.

Besides an exception list, all parts of a method are explained further in this unit. Exceptions are covered in a later unit.

## Method name
Every method has a name, followed by `()`.

By convention, method names are camel case. Here are some examples:

```
tick()
compareTo()
isSleeping()
calculateGrandTotal()
```

There are some rules for method names in Java:

-   Method names are restricted to characters `[A-Z]`, `[a-z]`, `[0-9]`, `$`, and `_`.
-   Method names can't start with a number.
-   Method names must not be a Java keyword.

## Method body
The method body is the code enclosed within the `{}` which follows the `()` of the method name:

```java
public void sayHello() {
    // Method body begins --
    System.out.println("Hello");
    // -- and ends
}
```

## Method return types
In the code example, the method declaration is `public void tick()`. The `void` part of that means the method doesn't return anything.

If you want your method to return something, you can specify the data type of what you want returned from a method. For example, if you want to return an `int` from a method, you'd write it like this:

```java
public int thisMethodReturnsInt() {

}
```

If you want it to return return a `String`, you'd write it this way:

```java
public String thisMethodReturnsString() {

}
```

Nearly any data type that you can use for a variable can be used as a method return type. You'll see more examples in this unit.

## Parameter list
Methods commonly accept values, or **arguments** passed into them through **parameters**.

You can think of a parameter list as a comma-delimited list of variables between the `()` following the method name. Remember all variables have a data type and a name, and the same is true of parameters.

Here are some examples of parameter lists:

```java
(String city)
(String name, int age)
(double cost, Integer quantity)
(Boolean isOnVacation, String location)
```

Parameters are optional, so a method may have _zero-to-many_ of them, and each may be of any data type.

To carry the parameters as variables analogy a bit further, think of parameters as **method-scoped** variables. They only exist within the body of the method and can only be referenced by code between the `{}` that define the method body.

In other words, parameters are windows into which values, or arguments, and passed into a method.

For example, you may want the clock to sound various alarm messages:

```java
// Clock.java
public String soundAlarm(String message) {
    return (this.getCurrentTime() + " - " + message);
}
```

```java
// Program.java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Clock alarmClock = new Clock();

    // Call the soundAlarm() method
    System.out.println(alarmClock.soundAlarm("Wake up sleepyhead"));
}
```

> Note: The argument, `"Wake up sleepyhead"`, is _passed-in_ through the `message` parameter.

The current time followed by a hyphen plus the message is displayed in the console:

```
8:52:17 - Wake up sleepyhead
```
