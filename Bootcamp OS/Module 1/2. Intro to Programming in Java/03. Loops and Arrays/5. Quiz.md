# Quiz

**Loops and Arrays 1**

```java
int x = 2;
int y = 5;
y += x;
```

What is the value of `y`?

**Answer:** 7

**Explanation:** The compound assignment operator `+=` adds the value on the right to the variable on the left.

---

**Loops and Arrays 2**

```java
String[] cities = {"Cleveland", "Columbus", "Cincinnati", "Akron", "Dayton"};

String result = cities[3];
```

What is the value of `result` after this code executes?

○ Cleveland

○ Columbus

○ Cincinnati

◉ Akron

○ Dayton

**Explanation:** "Akron" is the fourth element of the array, which means its index is 3.

---

**Loops and Arrays 3**

```java
boolean[] answers = { true, true, false, false };

answers[0] = false;
answers[2] = true;

for(int i = 0; i < answers.length; i++) {
    boolean b = answers[i];
    System.out.print(b + " ");
}
```

What does the preceding code fragment output?

○ true true false false

○ true true true false

◉ false true true false

○ false true false false

**Explanation:** This output shows that the first and third elements of the `answers` array have been changed.

---

**Loops and Arrays 4**

```java
int answer = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if(i % 2 == 0) {
        answer = answer + i;
    }
}
System.out.println(answer);
```

What value is displayed by this program?

**Answer:** 20

**Explanation:** 0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20

---

**Loops and Arrays 5**

```java
int sum = 0;
for(int i = 10; i > 0; i -= 3) {
    sum += i;
}
System.out.println(sum);
```

What value does the preceding fragment display?

**Answer:** 22

**Explanation:** 10 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 22

---

**Loops and Arrays 6**

```java
1)  int sum = 0;
2)  for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
3)      sum += i;
4)  }
5)  int count = i;
```

The preceding code fragment causes a compiler error. Which line causes the error?

○ Line 1

○ Line 2

○ Line 3

○ Line 4

◉ Line 5

**Explanation:** This line causes an error because the variable `i` is no longer in scope after the end of the `for` loop where it was declared.

---

**Loops and Arrays 7**

Given the following for loop:

```java
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    int sum = 0;
    sum += i;
    System.out.print(sum + " ");
}
```

What is the printed output of the preceding code?

○ 10

◉ 0 1 2 3 4

○ 0 1 3 6 10

○ 4 3 2 1 0

**Explanation:** `sum` is re-declared and initialized to 0 at the beginning of each iteration of the loop, so it doesn't accumulate a sum. If the intention was to add up all the values of `i`, the declaration of `sum` should be moved before the beginning of the loop.

---

**Loops and Arrays 8**

```java
int[] numbers = new int[10];
for(int ix = 0; ix < numbers.length; ix++) {
    numbers[ix] = ix * 2;
}

int result = numbers[3];
```

What is the value of `result` after this code executes?

**Answer:** 6

**Explanation:** After the `for` loop, `numbers` contains `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]`, so `numbers[3]` is six.
