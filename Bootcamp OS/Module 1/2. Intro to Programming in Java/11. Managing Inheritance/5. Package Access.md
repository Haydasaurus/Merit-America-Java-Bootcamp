# Package access

You've learned that you can make methods and properties available to all classes, no classes, and child classes. There's one more thing to know regarding access and packages.

In Java, classes grouped together in a package are typically related, even when there's no inheritance involved. Because of this, `protected` properties and methods are also accessible to classes in the same package.

Java also has a fourth type of access, sometimes called "default" or "package-private," that applies when you declare a property or method and don't specify any access modifier. Those properties and methods are only accessible within the same package, but not to classes outside the package, even if they're descendants. `protected` properties and methods are always accessible to descendants, regardless of what package they're in.

The following table summarizes where each of Java's access modifiers allows access:

| **Modifier**    | **Same Class?** | **Same Package?** | **Descendant?** | **Anywhere?** |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| public          | Yes             | Yes               | Yes             | Yes           |
| protected       | Yes             | Yes               | Yes             | No            |
| no modifier     | Yes             | Yes               | No              | No            |
| pivate          | Yes             | No                | No              | No            |
