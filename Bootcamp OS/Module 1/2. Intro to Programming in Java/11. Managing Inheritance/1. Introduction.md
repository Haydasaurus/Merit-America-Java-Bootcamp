# Introduction

You've learned in previous units that classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes. In this unit you'll learn how to use the keywords `abstract`, `final`, and `protected` to manage inheritance.

You'll often need to work with classes you didn't create. Understanding the requirements and restrictions a class places on inheritance helps you use the class in the way its designer intended.

When you're designing a new class, you can require other classes to implement certain methods, prevent other classes from overriding certain methods, and control which properties and methods child classes can access. Doing those things is an important way to communicate with other developers and helps ensure they use your code correctly.
