# Exception handling

Java includes the capability to help you handle any unexpected or exceptional situations while your program runs. The practice of anticipating these anomalies and addressing them is called **exception handling**.

When users interact with applications, you must expect them to make mistakes. If you don't, you're in for a surprise. In their defense, they expect your application to indicate that something went wrong, not display a cryptic error message.

When applications implement exception handling, they allow you:

-   The ability to display specific error messages
-   To notify other programmers that your code didn't finish its work

Without proper exception handling, exceptions go uncaught and can potentially reveal information about your program that you don't want your users to see.

There are a few things to know when it comes to working with exception handling:

1.  Exceptions are **_raised_** or **_thrown_**.
2.  Control of the program stops abruptly, and the exception bubbles up until it's **_caught_**.
3.  A **_caught_** exception handles the error and displays the message to the user or logs it.

The next lesson describes some approaches to implementing exception handling in your programs.
