# Try-catch

When you need to write code where there might be an exception, you use the `try` and `catch` keywords to handle the potential error:

```java
try {
    System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
    String s = input.nextLine();
    int result = Integer.parseInt(s);

    System.out.println("The number typed in is " + result + ".");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred.");
}

System.out.println("Thank you.");
```

**Example with valid input**

```
Enter a number: 2
The number typed in is 2.
Thank you.
```

**Example with invalid input**

```
Enter a number: two
An error occurred.
Thank you.
```

When a program throws an exception, the runtime finds the nearest `catch` statement to handle the exception. If the current method doesn't have a try-catch block, the exception **_bubbles up_** and looks for a `catch` block in the calling method. If an exception occurs, the remaining code in the `try` block doesn't run.

If there isn't an exception, the `try` block completes successfully and the `catch` block doesn't run.

>Try-catch blocks work with variable scope the same way that other blocks do. If you need a variable to be available to your entire try-catch block, you'll need to declare it in advance.
