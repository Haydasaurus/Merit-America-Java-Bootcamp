# Defensive programming

Exception handling is extremely useful and can help you avoid scenarios which may worry your users or make them think something bad happened.

Still, you can't rely on the runtime to tell you when there's a problem. If you can avoid the exception through _defensive programming_, you should at all costs.

Here are a few ways to avoid exceptions:

| Exception                      | How to Prevent It                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException | Confirm that your index is within the bounds of the array or list first.                                                                                                                                        |
| ArithmeticException            | Make sure that your divisor isn't equal to 0 first.                                                                                                                                                             |
| NullPointerException           | Check if the reference object you're acting on is != null before calling any properties or methods on it.                                                                                                       |
| FileNotFoundException          | Use File.Exists() before accessing a folder or file that might not exist due to bad input or something deleted.                                                                                                 |
| IllegalArgumentException       | Use user-interface validation first to inform the user that they typed in an invalid value and to try again. This doesn't remove the need for an IllegalArgumentException, but it cuts down on the occurrences. |
