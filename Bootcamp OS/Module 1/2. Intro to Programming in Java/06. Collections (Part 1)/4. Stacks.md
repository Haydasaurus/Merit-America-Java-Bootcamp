# Stacks

Similar to `List`, but a far less commonly used collection class, is `Stack`. Like the `List` class, `Stack` maintains the order in which items are added to and removed from the collection. In fact, the preservation of the order is the very essence of the `Stack` class.

A `Stack` is a last-in, first-out (**LIFO**) data structure. `Stack`s allow you to "push" and "pop" items on and off the top of the collection.

A commonly used analogy is a stack of dinner trays. Adding or removing trays is only possible at the top.

## Note: Real world usage
Stacks are most often used when applications need to implement an **undo feature**. The individual actions the user performs are added, or _pushed_ onto the stack one action at a time.

When the user decides to "undo" an operation, the most recent action is removed, or _popped_ off the top of the stack, before it's undone. The second to last action is now at the top. If the user decides to undo another action, the now top action is popped and undone. The process repeats, and subsequent "undoings" result in the actions being undone in the reverse order they were done.

### Creating a `Stack`
To use `Stack`s, use this `import` statement:

```java
import java.util.Stack;
```

The syntax for creating a `Stack` is `Stack<T> identifier = new Stack<T>()`. So if you want a `Stack` of `String`s, you'd write:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();
```

As discussed earlier, the type can be any reference data type you want. Here, you can see a `Stack` that holds `LocalDate` objects, and another one that holds `Integer`s:

```java
Stack<LocalDate> schedule = new Stack<LocalDate>();
Stack<Integer> sequence = new Stack<Integer>();
```

### Adding items to a `Stack`
`Stack`s use a `push()` method instead of `add()`. The `push()` method adds an item to the top of the `Stack`:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();

names.push("C3PO");  // names now contains C3PO
names.push("R2-D2"); // names now contains R2-D2, C3PO
names.push("BB-8");  // names now contains BB-8, R2-D2, C3PO
```

### Removing items from a `Stack`
The method for removing items is `pop()`. This always removes the latest item from the top of the stack:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();

// ... C3PO, then R2-D2, then BB-8 are pushed onto the stack

String name = names.pop();  // name contains BB-8 since that was the last name placed on the stack
                            // and names contains R2-D2, C3PO
```

If you try to `pop()` an empty stack, an `EmptyStackException` exception occurs. It's best to check the `size()` to make sure at least one item exists before calling `pop()`. You can also use a while loop, which you can see an example of in the ["Looping through a stack"](https://lms.techelevator.com/cohorts/42/blocks/7/content_files/06_Collections_Part_1_Lists_Stacks_Queues/04-stacks.md#stack-looping) section below.

## Note: Java exceptions
An _exception_ is Java's term for an error that occurs while your program is running.

You can learn more about Java Exceptions in [The Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/) .

If you want to check the next item in the `Stack` without removing it, you can use the `peek()` method:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();

// ... C3PO, then R2-D2, then BB-8 are pushed onto the stack

String name = names.pop();  // name contains BB-8 since that was the last name placed on the stack
                            // and names contains R2-D2, C3PO

String peekName = names.peek(); // peekName contains R2-D2
                                // names still contains R2-D2, C3PO
```

### Looping through a `Stack`
`Stack`s don't support a way of accessing specific elements by index. However, you can enumerate through the `Stack` using a foreach loop:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();

//... push names on to the stack

for(String name : names) {
    // The name isn't removed from the stack.
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

When you enumerate using a foreach loop, you can safely read items, but you can't modify any of them. If you want to look at each item and remove it with `pop()`, you'll need a different way such as using a `while` loop:

```java
Stack<String> names = new Stack<String>();

//... push names on to the stack

while (names.size() > 0)
{
    String name = names.pop(); // the next item is removed from the stack
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

### Other methods
This lesson covered the more common methods that `Stack`s contain, but it's important to know that there are many other methods that exist to make your job easier. Explore and experiment with the IntelliSense to see what other methods you can discover.
