# Lectures

No amount of reading or code-along tutorial replaces the learning you can obtain from live instruction. As you work through the course material, you'll participate in lectures led by professional software developers. They'll rely on their experience to create interactive classroom discussions that provide context so that you can better understand the material.

## Preparing for class
Your instructors expect you to work through the relevant self-study materials before attending class. Self-study materials include reading the lessons, completing the tutorials, and taking the quiz.

Take notes when you read or do something in the self-study materials that isn't clear. Your answers on the quiz inform the instructor which concepts to reinforce and where they can spend more time in class.

## What to expect during the lecture
While in class, you'll participate in an interactive discussion with your instructor. They'll share real-world examples that help you better understand the learning objectives. They'll also demonstrate the concept with an additional coding example.

Some instructors may distribute additional materials, such as slides or diagrams, to help drive the lecture. Others may rely primarily on a whiteboard to teach. You'll get the most out of the discussion when you follow along, ask questions for clarity, and attempt to demonstrate your understanding in your own words.
