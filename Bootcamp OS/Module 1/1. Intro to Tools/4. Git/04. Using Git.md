# Using Git

## The Git workflow
Working with Git requires you to follow a special workflow. It starts with copying the code to your machine. You then proceed to make changes locally, stage and commit those changes, and when ready, push to preserve them. For most developers, the cycle of change, stage, commit, and push occurs at least once on a daily basis.

It's broken down into the following steps:

1.  Prepare your machine to edit the code, typically by cloning a remote repository to a local repository on your machine.
2.  Make edits to the local files and folders. This includes adding new, moving, deleting and renaming existing files and folders. Git calls the entire set of files and folders the **_working tree_**, but to you it's just your local folders and files. All of which means that Git is **_tool agnostic_**. Git doesn't care what tool or tools you used to manipulate the files and folders, changes are changes, and Git can handle them all.
3.  Once you're satisfied with a set of changes, **_stage_** the modified files and folders. Git places the changes into a special place it calls the **_index tree_** or the **_staging index_**. The staging index reflects all the changes to include in the next commit. You may stage multiple times before committing.
4.  Once you've staged all the changes and you know you want to keep them, **_commit_** the staged changes, providing a clear message indicating the purpose of the modifications. Git places these commits into its **_commit tree_**. Developers refer to this as "committing the changes to the repository."
5.  Now you can **_push_** your changes. This sends all of the commits that you made locally to the remote repository from which you cloned your local repository.
