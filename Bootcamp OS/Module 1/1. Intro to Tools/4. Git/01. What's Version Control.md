# What's version control?

Whether you work individually or on a team, protecting the source code for a software project is important. **Version control** is software often used to help track the changes over time to a codebase. Version control systems are a category of software tools that help teams manage changes to source code over time. They offer three major benefits:
1.  Teams can **_go back in time_** when a bug occurs and compare different versions of the source code.
2.  Version control simplifies sharing changes between team members, which guarantees that everyone has the latest copy.
3.  Team members can develop code in parallel through the use of branches and merge them together when complete.

Watch the following video to learn how version control can benefit any type of collaborative team.
