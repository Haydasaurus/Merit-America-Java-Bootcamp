# Creating a repository

To begin working with an existing repository, a developer needs the remote URL so they can clone the repository to the computer as a local repository. A remote URL is Git's way of identifying "a place where code is stored."

This URL may reference a location on GitHub, Bitbucket, or another server. On GitHub, it's usually found on the home screen of the repository and in the format of `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git`. The URL always ends with `.git`.

With this URL, you run the command `git clone` from the command line to download a copy of the repository:
```shell
git clone <remote-url>
```

Once you _clone_ a remote repository, you have the entire codebase and are free to begin making changes.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Warning: Clone location**
>
>When you use the `git clone` command, git automatically creates a folder for you in the location of your current working directory. Be careful not to perform this command inside of an existing git repository.
