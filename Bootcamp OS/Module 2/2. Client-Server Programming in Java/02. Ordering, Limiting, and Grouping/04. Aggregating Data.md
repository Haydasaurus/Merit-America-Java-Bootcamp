# Aggregating data

So far, you've been selecting rows of data from the database and returning it. But sometimes you might want additional _information_ than the data itself provides.

For instance, you may want to know how many children are in the the `child` table. You could select them all with a `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child;
```

Then manually count the rows displayed:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |

But this isn't practical for large tables with many rows, and completely unnecessary thanks to **aggregate functions**.

## Aggregate functions

Instead of manually counting the rows, you can tell the database to count the rows like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM child;
```

Result:

| **count** |
| --------- |
| 4         |

Using these functions, you can collapse your data down into pieces of information. `COUNT(*)` tells you how many rows are returned from the statement.

You can use `WHERE` clauses to filter the data down too. If you run the following statement:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM child WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
```

It gives you this result:

| **count** |
| --------- |
| 2         |

So, `COUNT(*)` counts the number of rows.

There are some other aggregate functions, too.

`AVG(column)` returns the average value in a certain column:

```sql
SELECT AVG(age) FROM child;
```

| **avg** |     
| ------- | 
| 9.5     |   

`SUM(column)` adds up all the value from a certain column:

```sql
SELECT SUM(age) FROM child;
```

| **sum** |   
| ------- | 
| 38      |  

`MIN(column)` gives you the smallest value in that column:

```sql
SELECT MIN(age) FROM child;
```

| **min** |  
| ------- | 
| 8       | 

`MAX(column)` gives you the largest value in that column:

```sql
SELECT MAX(age) FROM child;
```

| **max** |  
| ------- | 
| 11      |
