# Ordering rows

By default, rows come back from the database in an unspecified order. It's up to the DBMS to decide how it returns rows from a `SELECT` statement. However, by adding an `ORDER BY` clause, you can set the order the database returns your rows in.

Look at the following statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY age;
```

This statement orders your results by the children's ages, but in what order? Youngest to oldest or oldest to youngest?

By default, all `ORDER BY` clauses are `ASC` or ascending, starting at the lowest value and going to the highest value. So if you're ordering by a number, the first row you get back has the lowest value, and the last row has the highest value. For strings, `a` is considered the lowest value, so `ASC` order goes from `a` to `z`, which means it's alphabetical.

Since `ASC` is the default order if one isn't specified, you could write the previous SQL statement like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY age ASC;
```

Now, imagine that you have the following rows in your database:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |

If you use the following statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY age ASC;
```

It gives you these results:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |

If you use this one:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY age DESC;
```

It gives you these results:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |

## Alphabetical sorting
If you use this statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY last_name ASC;
```

You'll get these results:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |

### Why aren't Nick and Adam alphabetical?
You ordered by `last_name` and now all the rows are sorted alphabetically by the `last_name` column. But shouldn't Adam be before Nick? Why would the database not sort that as well?

The answer is because you didn't tell it to. Computers only do what you tell them to do.

## Multiple `ORDER BY` clauses
In the SQL statement, you never defined that you wanted the `first_name` to be sorted too, so the database left it alone. However, you can fix that by changing your statement to say, "First, sort by `last_name`, then sort by `first_name`":

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;
```

This statement gives you these results:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |

Adding two columns to the `ORDER BY` clause indicates to the server that you want it to first sort by the first column and **_then_** sort by the second column.

In other words, this clause says to order by the children's last names first and then, **_if any of the last names are duplicates_**, order by those children's first names:

```sql
ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC
```
