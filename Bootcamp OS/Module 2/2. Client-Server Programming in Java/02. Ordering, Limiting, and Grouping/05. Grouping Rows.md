What if you wanted to know how many children have the last name of Smith? You learned how to do this earlier:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child;
```

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM child WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
```

| **count** |
| --------- |
| 2         |

But what if you want to know how many children have _each_ last name? Currently, you'd have to run a new statement per last name in the database, which you don't want to do.

If you want to aggregate data by a column in the table, you'd group rows together based on the column:

```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) FROM child GROUP BY last_name;
```

| **last_name** | **count** |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Smith         | 2         |
| Gold          | 1         |
| Claus         | 1         |

So what does `GROUP BY` do? It groups rows of data together that contain the same value so that you can aggregate them together.

This statement orders the database to group the rows by `last_name` from `child`:

```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) FROM child GROUP BY last_name;
```

Because there's no `WHERE` clause, it uses all the rows.

So first, the database gathers all the rows:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |

Next, it groups them by `last_name`:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Beatrice       | Gold          | 8       |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Zachary        | Claus         | 9       |

And then collapses the rows down to just the `last_name` and the `COUNT(*)` from the `SELECT` clause, as you saw earlier.

| **last_name** | **count** |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Smith         | 2         |
| Gold          | 1         |
| Claus         | 1         |

Can you see who all has that `last_name`?

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) FROM child GROUP BY last_name;
```

Result:

```sql
ERROR: selected columns must be in GROUP BY clause
```

You can't select the first names because all the first names in the groups are different.

When the Smiths are grouped, you have the following rows in that group:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
| Adam           | Smith         | 10      |

Selecting the `last_name` from that group as one data point is possible because they all have the same `last_name`, but selecting the `first_name` is harder. Which `first_name` do you choose? Nick or Adam?

You can only take one value, and the database doesn't know which one you want, so it doesn't even try. However, `COUNT(*)` takes those two rows and turns them into one value, so that works just as expected and returns a `2`:

| **last_name** | **count** |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Smith         | 2         |

`GROUP BY` is all about taking multiple rows and collapsing them down into one row. How you want them collapsed depends on what information you're trying to see.

## Grouping by multiple columns

So how can you get meaningful information from the pieces of data in your tables? Take the following `student` table as an example:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Monica         | Carlo         | PA        | Java      |
| Doug           | Marshal       | PA        | C#        |
| Greg           | Bishop        | OH        | C#        |
| Betty          | Raines        | OH        | Java      |
| Ted            | Dorsey        | PA        | Java      |
| Susan          | Granger       | PA        | C#        |

If you wanted to know how many students came from each state, you could write that as:

```sql
SELECT state, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY state ORDER BY state;
```

| **state** | **count** |
| --------- | --------- |
| OH        | 2         |
| PA        | 4         |

If you wanted to know how many students are in each class, you could write:

```sql
SELECT class, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY class ORDER BY class;
```

| **class** ** | count** |
| ------------ | ------- |
| C#           | 3       |
| Java         | 3       |

What if you wanted to see how many students from each state are in each class? For this, you can `GROUP BY` on two different columns:

```sql
SELECT state, class, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY state, class ORDER BY class, state;
```

This first gathers the rows and groups them by state:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Monica         | Carlo         | PA        | Java      |
| Doug           | Marshal       | PA        | C#        |
| Susan          | Granger       | PA        | C#        |
| Ted            | Dorsey        | PA        | Java      |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Greg           | Bishop        | OH        | C#        |
| Betty          | Raines        | OH        | Java      |

It then groups those groups into classes:

| **first_name** **last_name** | **state** | **class** |      |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---- |
| Monica                       | Carlo     | PA        | Java |
| Ted                          | Dorsey    | PA        | Java |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Doug           | Marshal       | PA        | C#        |
| Susan          | Granger       | PA        | C#        |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Greg           | Bishop        | OH        | C#        |
|                |               |           |           |

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **state** | **class** |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Betty          | Raines        | OH        | Java      |

And then runs the select to collapse these groups into one row each:

| **state** | **class** | **count** |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| PA        | Java      | 2         |
| PA        | C#        | 2         |
| OH        | C#        | 1         |
| OH        | Java      | 1         |

Finally you sort, first by class:

| **state** | **class** ** | count** |
| --------- | ------------ | ------- |
| PA        | C#           | 2       |
| OH        | C#           | 1       |
| PA        | Java         | 2       |
| OH        | Java         | 1       |

Then by state:

| **state** | **class** | **count** |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| OH        | C#        | 1         |
| PA        | C#        | 2         |
| OH        | Java      | 1         |
| PA        | Java      | 2         |

And there are the results.
