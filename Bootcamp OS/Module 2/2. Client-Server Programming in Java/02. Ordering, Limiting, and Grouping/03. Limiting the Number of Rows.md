# Limiting the number of rows

You can also add another clause to your SQL to only return a certain number of rows, called the `LIMIT` clause. This can be useful for retrieving the top result of a query or for paging results from a SQL query.

If you want to retrieve the oldest child in the table, run this statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 1;
```

It gives you this result:

| **first_name** | **last_name** | **age** |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Nick           | Smith         | 11      |
