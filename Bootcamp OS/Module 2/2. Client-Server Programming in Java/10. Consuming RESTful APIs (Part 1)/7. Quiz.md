**Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 1**

What does it mean to "consume an API?"

○ Use an API too much

○ Register for an account to use an API

○ Interact with an API in code

**Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 2**

What does a deserializer do?

	Select all correct options

□ Sends an HTTP request

□ Creates an object

□ Replaces the JSON string with a modified JSON string

□ Sets the values of properties with matching names

---

**Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 3**

How would you determine that `RestTemplate` received a response status code in the 400-599 range that indicates an error?

○ `RestTemplate` throws an exception

○ `getForObject()` returns null

○ The response status code stored in `RestTemplate` is in that range

○ Deserializing the JSON fails

---

**Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 4**

How can you have the `getObject()` method of `RestTemplate` return an object of type `Person`?

○ By assigning the result to a variable of type `Person`

○ By specifying `Person.class` as a parameter

○ By specifying `Person` as a parameter

○ By casting the result as a `Person`

**Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 5**

True or False: In order to deserialize JSON into an object, all the properties present in the JSON must also be present in the object.

○ True

○ False

**Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 6**

What's the output of this program if the JSON string returned by the API endpoint `http://localhost:3000/snacks/1` is `{"snack_name": "Potato Crisps", "slot": "A1"}`?

```java
//---Snack.java---
public class Snack {
    @JsonProperty("slot")
    private String position = "";

    private String name = "";

    // Assume standard getters and setters.
}

//---Example.java---
public static void main(String[] args) {
    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
    Snack snack =
        restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:3000/snacks/1", Snack.class);
    System.out.println("Snack: " + snack.getName());
    System.out.println("Position: " + snack.getPosition());
}
```

○
```shell
Snack: Potato Crisps  
Position: A1
```

○
```shell
Snack: Potato Crisps  
Position:
```

○
```shell
Snack:  
Position: A1
```

○
```shell
Snack:  
Position:
```

**Consuming RESTful APIs (Part 1) 7**

If this JSON was returned by the API endpoint `http://localhost:3000/snacks`, which one of these lines of code would be correct?

```json
[
    {"snack_name": "Potato Crisps", "slot": "A1"},
    {"snack_name": "Stackers", "slot": "A2"},
    {"snack_name": "Grain Waves", "slot": "A3"}
]
```

○ `Snack snacks = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:3000/snacks", Snack.class);`

○ `Snack[] snacks = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:3000/snacks", Snack.class);`

○ `Snack snacks = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:3000/snacks", Snack[].class);`

○ `Snack[] snacks = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:3000/snacks", Snack[].class);`

What order do the following events happen in when your code calls an API with the `getObject()` method of `RestTemplate`?

▤ `RestTemplate` may throw an exception based on the response status code

▤ The deserializer creates a new object

▤ The deserializer sets values for properties with matching names

▤ An HTTP response is received

▤ `getObject()` returns an object to your code

▤ An HTTP GET request is sent
