# The WHERE clause

There are times when you don't want to select all the rows stored in a table. If you want to pick and choose which _rows_ to pull back from the database, you need to use a `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM country WHERE continent = 'North America';
```

Result: 
| **code** | **name**           | **continent** | **region**      |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| CYM      | Cayman Islands     | North America | Caribbean       |
| CRI      | Costa Rica         | North America | Central America |
| DMA      | Dominica           | North America | Caribbean       |
| DOM      | Dominican Republic | North America | Caribbean       |
| ...      | ...                | ...           | ...             |

In defining a `WHERE` clause, you only extract the rows you want from the database. In this example, the database pulls rows where the data in continent is equal to 'North America.'

## Note: Equality in SQL

In Java, you use double equals to see if two things are equal. In SQL, you use one equal.

## Conditionals

Specifying conditionals in `WHERE` clauses narrows down which rows to select from the database. Much like a conditional in an `if` statement, the `WHERE` clause conditional only selects rows where the conditional evaluates to true.

All of the standard conditionals that you already know—like `=`, `<`, `>`—are also available in SQL. There are some new ones too:

| **Operator**              | **Numbers**                                                               | **Characters**                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| =                         | Equal To                                                                  | Equal To                                                                  |
| <>, !=                    | Not Equal To                                                              | Not Equal To                                                              |
| <                         | Less Than                                                                 | Alphabetically Before                                                     |
| >                         | Greater Than                                                              | Alphabetically After                                                      |
| <=                        | Less Than or Equal                                                        | Alphabetically Before or Equal                                            |
| >=                        | Greater Than                                                              | Alphabetically After or Equal                                             |
| IN (value1, value2, ...)  | Is Value in List                                                          | Is Value in List                                                          |
| BETWEEN value1 AND value2 | Is Value Greater Than or Equal to value1 and Less Than or Equal to value2 | Is Value Greater Than or Equal to value1 and Less Than or Equal to value2 |
| IS NULL                   | Equal To Null                                                             | Equal To Null                                                             |

## Note: `NULL` value in SQL

`NULL` has a different meaning in SQL than in other programming languages. In OOP languages such as Java, `NULL` means that a variable doesn't contain an object. In SQL, `NULL` means that a value hasn't been set on the column when the row was submitted. So a column is `NULL` if it doesn't have a value. For example, if you have a table of people and need to put Madonna or Cher in the table, the `last_name` column for those rows is `NULL`.

### The `IN` conditional

The `IN` conditional works like multiple `OR` conditions for one column and multiple values. For example, if you wanted to get people named Mary, Ted, or Alex, you'd write a query like this:

```sql
-- Get all people with the first name of Mary, Ted, or Alex
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE first_name IN ('Mary', 'Ted', 'Alex');
```

### The `BETWEEN` conditional

The `BETWEEN` conditional is like using a greater than or equal (`>=`) and a less than or equal (`<=`) together. This query is equivalent to using `WHERE age >= 18 AND age <= 34`:

```sql
-- Get all people whose age is between 18 and 34 (inclusive)
SELECT first_name, last_name, age FROM person WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 34;
```

You can also use `NOT` in front of `BETWEEN` to get all rows that aren't in a range:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, age FROM person WHERE age NOT BETWEEN 18 AND 34;
```

### The `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` conditionals

You can use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` to retrieve rows where a value is or isn't null:

```sql
-- Get all people who don't have a favorite color
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE favorite_color IS NULL;

-- Get all people who DO have a favorite color
SELECT first_name, last_name, color FROM person WHERE favorite_color IS NOT NULL;
```

### Using dates in conditionals

When you use a date in SQL, you surround it with single quotes like a string. Write dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

You can use dates in `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `IN`, and `BETWEEN` conditionals:

```sql
-- Get all people born on Jan 5, 1970, or later
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE birth_date >= '1970-01-05';

-- Get all people born between Jan 1, 1990 and Dec 31, 1999
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '1999-12-31';
```

### The `LIKE` conditional

`LIKE` is a special conditional that only works with character data. It allows for "wildcard" searches. Look at the following SQL statement:

```sql
-- Get all last names that end in son
SELECT last_name FROM person WHERE last_name LIKE '%son';
```

This statement returns all rows where the `last_name` ends in `son`. The `%` is called a **wildcard**. It matches anything, so the preceding statement returns names like Erickson, Benson, and Danielson, but it won't return sonny or Wilsonn. The string must end in `son` because the `%` is at the beginning.

If you want to only get rows where the `last_name` _begins_ with `Ba`, write the following:

```sql
-- Get all last names that begin with Ba
SELECT last_name FROM person WHERE last_name LIKE 'Ba%';
```

If you want to only get rows where the `last_name` has the string `ski` anywhere in it, including having the string start with or end with `ski`, write the following:

```sql
-- Get all last names that contain ski anywhere
SELECT last_name FROM person WHERE last_name LIKE '%ski%';
```

### Combining conditionals with `AND` and `OR`

You can put conditionals together in a `SELECT` statement to get the rows you want.

For example, if you have a `person` table and want to get all the rows that represent children, you could write a statement like this:

```sql
-- Select all children from the database
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE age < 18;
```

You can also combine these conditionals using the keywords `AND` and `OR` to make more complex statements:

```sql
-- Select all the first names of children with a last name of Smith from the database
SELECT first_name FROM person WHERE age < 18 AND last_name = 'Smith';
```
