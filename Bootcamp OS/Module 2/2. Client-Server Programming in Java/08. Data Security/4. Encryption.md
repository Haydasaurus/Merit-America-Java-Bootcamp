# Encryption

The other way data can be safeguarded in a database or in transit is by using encryption. In cryptography, **encryption** is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it, and those who are not authorized cannot. You do this by using an encryption algorithm that takes a value—maybe a string or binary data—and scrambles it using some sort of key. There are two types of encryption used in applications: symmetric key encryption and asymmetric key encryption.

## Symmetric key encryption

Symmetric cryptography involves the parties sharing a common secret passphrase or key. Data is encrypted and decrypted using the same key.

This is commonly what people think of when they think of encryption. If you've ever encrypted a Zip file or PDF with a password, this is the kind of encryption being used.

Bob can write a message that he only wants Alice to see, so he encrypts it using symmetric encryption using a secret key that he created, typically a password. He then needs to get the now encrypted message to Alice and the password. Once Alice has the encrypted message and the password, she can decrypt the message and read the plain text again.

There are many different symmetric encryption algorithms in use today. Three well-known encryption algorithms are _DES_, _3DES_, and _AES_.

Symmetric encryption is great, but only if you can keep the secret key out of the hands of attackers. If Bob wants to send Alice a message, he needs to get her the encrypted message _and_ the password. That makes it hard to send along messages if the two users have no other way of communicating or have never met each other. That means for Internet communication, like passing encrypted information between an e-commerce site and a customer, symmetric encryption isn't very useful.

## Asymmetric key encryption

The type of encryption used in most Internet communication is called asymmetric encryption. **Asymmetric cryptography** is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: _public keys_ which may be disseminated widely, and _private keys_ which are known only to the owner.

If a Bob wants to send a message to Alice now, he needs to get Alice's public key. This is something that Alice can freely give to anyone and happily sends it to Bob over email. Bob can then take the message and encrypt it using Alice's public key.

However, no one can decrypt the message using the public key. The encryption only happens in one direction. If a message is encrypted using a public key, only a related private key can decrypt it. Alice keeps the private key to herself and never gives that to anyone. When she gets a message encrypted with her public key, she can decrypt it and read what the message is.

This is how encryption works on the Internet. Amazon.com creates a pair of public and private keys. It sends the public key to anyone visiting the site. A user's browser then encrypts requests to Amazon with their public key and send that over the Internet. Amazon, however, is the only one that can read it because they're the only ones that have their private key.
