# Join clauses

So far, you've learned how to select data from a table in the database. Now, you'll learn how to select data from more than one table at a time. This is called **joining**. It's one of the most powerful ways that you can pull information from your databases.

Look again at the `city` and `country` tables:

**country**

| **country_id** | **name** |
| -------------- | -------- |
| 1              | Canada   |
| 2              | Mexico   |
| 3              | Cuba     |
| 4              | France   |
| 5              | Spain    |
| 6              | Italy    |
| 7              | China    |

**city**

| **city_id** | **country_id** | **name** |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1           | 6              | Milan    |
| 2           | 6              | Rome     |
| 3           | 7              | Beijing  |
| 4           | 4              | Nice     |
| 5           | 4              | Paris    |
| 6           | 1              | Toronto  |
| 7           | 5              | Seville  |

If you want to select all the cities in France, you'd write this:

```sql
SELECT name FROM city WHERE country_id=4;
```

That works, but only if you know that the id of France is 4. But what if you don't know that? What if you want to select all the cities by only knowing the name of the country?

You could write a statement that looks like this:

```sql
SELECT name FROM city 
WHERE country_id = (SELECT country_id from country WHERE name='France');
```

This query uses a **subquery**. You can use a subquery to run a `SELECT` statement inside another statement. The subquery runs first and pulls back the id of the country whose name is France. You can then use that in your other `SELECT` statement to pull back all the cities in that country. Now you don't have to hard code ids and memorize every id in your database.

But subqueries only work for so many things, and they're slow. It'd be best to use a `JOIN` clause for this type of query.

## Joining tables

You can write the previous query using a `JOIN` clause as well:

```sql
SELECT city.name FROM city
JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
WHERE country.name='France';
```

You can use `JOIN` clauses to join up the rows of one table to the rows of another table, essentially giving you a combined row of information that you can then select from.

Look again at the earlier `JOIN` clause:

```sql
FROM city JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
```

That clause gives you rows that look like this:

| **city_id** | **country_id** | **name** | **country_id** | **name** |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1           | 6              | Milan    | 6              | Italy    |
| 2           | 6              | Rome     | 6              | Italy    |
| 3           | 7              | Beijing  | 7              | China    |
| 4           | 4              | Nice     | 4              | France   |
| 5           | 4              | Paris    | 4              | France   |
| 6           | 1              | Toronto  | 1              | Canada   |
| 7           | 5              | Seville  | 5              | Spain    |

You've joined the two tables together where the `city.country_id = country.country_id`. You can see that the country can be duplicated, like for Milan and Rome, because more than one city has the same country.

Then you can select your columns from this new joined table. Since both `city` and `country` have a name column, you have to specify _which_ name column you want in the `SELECT` clause:

```sql
SELECT city.name FROM city
JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
```

Then, you only want the rows that have 'France' in the country:

```sql
SELECT city.name FROM city
JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
WHERE country.name = 'France';
```

That clause gives you these rows:

| **name** |
| -------- |
| Nice     |
| Paris    |

You could also change that statement to this:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(city.name, ', ', country.name) AS display_name FROM city
JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
WHERE country.name = 'France';
```

This is the result:

| **display_name** |
| ---------------- |
| Nice, France     |
| Paris, France    |

## Joining multiple tables

Think back to the actors and films example. From that example, imagine that you have an `actor` table that looks like this:

**actor**

| **actor_id** | **name**     |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 1            | Brad Pitt    |
| 2            | Bruce Willis |
| 3            | Chris Evans  |
| 4            | Alan Rickman |
| 5            | Ed Norton    |
| 6            | Tom Cruise   |

And `film`:

**film**

| **film_id** | **name**         |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | Die Hard         |
| 2           | Fight Club       |
| 3           | Moonrise Kingdom |
| 4           | 12 Monkeys       |

And, finally, the join table, `actor_film`:

**actor_film**

| **actor_id** | **film_id** |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| 2            | 1           |
| 4            | 1           |
| 5            | 2           |
| 1            | 2           |
| 5            | 3           |
| 2            | 3           |
| 1            | 4           |
| 2            | 4           |

Using this table, you can pull information about both actors and films by joining the tables together. If you wanted to get the name and all of the films from actors whose names start with 'B', you'd do the following:

```sql
SELECT actor.name, film.name FROM actor
JOIN actor_film ON actor_film.actor_id = actor.actor_id
JOIN film ON film.film_id = actor_film.film_id
WHERE actor.name LIKE 'B%';
```

| **name**     | **name**         |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Brad Pitt    | Fight Club       |
| Brad Pitt    | 12 Monkeys       |
| Bruce Willis | Die Hard         |
| Bruce Willis | Moonrise Kingdom |
| Bruce Willis | 12 Monkeys       |

You'll see that a lot of the values were duplicated, but each combination is unique. As the database joins the rows of different tables to each other, it creates as many rows as need to join all of the information.

When you select from `actor`, you only get two rows: `Brad Pitt` and `Bruce Willis`. But then you join the `actor_film` table on and the `film` table. Since Brad Pitt has been in two of the films, his name is attached to both of those rows and the value is duplicated. But that's okay. Each row has all the information you need from that call.

However, if you want to know how many movies each actor has been in, you'd need to write a different query.

First, you'd need to pull data from the `actor` table and join that to the `film` table:

```sql
FROM actor
JOIN actor_film ON actor_film.actor_id = actor.actor_id
JOIN film ON film.film_id = actor_film.film_id
```

You want to count the films, so if you group the rows by the actor, you can `COUNT` the number of films for each actor:

```sql
FROM actor
JOIN actor_film ON actor_film.actor_id = actor.actor_id
JOIN film ON film.film_id = actor_film.film_id
GROUP BY actor.actor_id, actor.name
```

And then you can select the actor's name and how many rows were returned for that actor:

```sql
SELECT actor.name, COUNT(*) AS num_of_films
FROM actor
JOIN actor_film ON actor_film.actor_id = actor.actor_id
JOIN film ON film.film_id = actor_film.film_id
GROUP BY actor.actor_id, actor.name
```

| **name**     | **num_of_films** |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Brad Pitt    | 2                |
| Bruce Willis | 3                |
| Alan Rickman | 1                |
| Ed Norton    | 2                |

Notice that Tom Cruise doesn't appear in the results. This is because he isn't linked in the database to any films. Since he isn't joined to any films, when you join the `actor_film` table in, his name disappears from the list. The same happens with Chris Evans.
