# Introduction

You've learned how to retrieve data from a database, but how does that data get there in the first place? Part of the usefulness of databases is storing and retrieving data, but that usefulness diminishes if you can't also change the data. For instance, what if your database stored class rostersâ€”how would you handle adding a new student that signed up late, or removing them if they dropped the course?

Thankfully, there are three SQL statements that can add, change, and remove data from the database.
