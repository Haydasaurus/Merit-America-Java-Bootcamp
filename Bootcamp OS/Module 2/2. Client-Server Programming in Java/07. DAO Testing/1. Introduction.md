# Introduction

Writing tests is an important aspect of any software development, and DAOs are no exception. However, writing tests for DAOs is more complicated because DAOs depend on a database. Tests that involve outside dependencies are **integration tests**, and in this unit you'll learn how they're similar to and different from the unit tests you're already familiar with. You'll also learn how mock data and transactions enable you to write DAO tests that are reliable and effective.
