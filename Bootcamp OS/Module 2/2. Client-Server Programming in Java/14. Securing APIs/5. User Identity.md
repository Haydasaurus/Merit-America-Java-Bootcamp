# User identity

There are situations where you not only want to know that the user is authenticated and that they have a certain role, but more specifically, the identity of the user. For example, while adding a new location, you also want to log which user created it. You can do so by declaring a new argument on your method of type `Principal`, and it'll be resolved by the Spring Framework. Once you have a `Principal` object, you can get the current user by calling `getName()`:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
@RequestMapping(value = "", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public Location add(@Valid @RequestBody Location location, Principal principal) {
    System.out.println(principal.getName());
    return dao.create(location);
}
```

## Note: What's a principal?

In Spring Security, the current logged-in user is a **Principal**. A principal in computer security is an entity that can be authenticated by a computer system or network.

Right now, you may wonder how you can declare a type of `Principal` and get the current logged-in user. For now, understand that if you declare [one of these types](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-methods) in a method that's annotated with `@RequestMapping`, the Spring Framework tries to resolve it for you.
