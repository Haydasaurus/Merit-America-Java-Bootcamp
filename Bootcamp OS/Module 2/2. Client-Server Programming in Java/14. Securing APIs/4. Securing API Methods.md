# Securing API methods

By default, all of the endpoints in your API are open to anyone who wants to call them. Inevitably, you'll want to secure your API endpoints. Spring Security provides the `@PreAuthorize` annotation which determines whether the user can invoke the method or not. The `@PreAuthorize` annotation takes in a Spring Expression as an argument.

The Spring Expression Language ("SpEL" for short) is a powerful expression language that supports querying and manipulating classes at runtime. This isn't something you need to fully understand, but if you want to learn more, you can read the [SpEL documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions) .

The [Spring Security documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/expression-based.html) includes a list of common expressions that you can use to secure your API endpoints. You'll mainly use the following expressions:

-   `@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")`: The user must be authenticated.
-   `@PreAuthorize("permitAll")`: The user doesn't have to be authenticated.
-   `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`: The user must be authenticated and have the role ADMIN.
-   `@PreAuthorize("hasAnyRole('ADMIN', 'USER')")`: The user must be authenticated and have either the ADMIN or USER role.

Here's an example of class-based authentication where each method inherits from the class rule of `isAuthenticated()`:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/locations")
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
public class LocationController {

    @RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Location> list() {
        // inherits authentication from controller
    }

    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    @RequestMapping(value = "", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public Location add(@Valid @RequestBody Location location) {
        // inherits authentication from controller
    }

}
```

Here's an example of method authorization:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/locations")
public class LocationController {

    @PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
    @RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Location> list() {
        // you must be authenticated to invoke this method
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/public", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public void notsecure() {
        // this method doesn't require authentication
    }

}
```

## Allow anonymous access

If you need to make one action method open to anonymous access—meaning no authorization—while the rest of the controller requires authorization, you can use the `permitAll` expression in the `@PreAuthorize` annotation. A good use case for this is when you have an action method for users to log in along the same route for methods that do require authorization:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
public class UserController {

    @PreAuthorize("permitAll")
    @RequestMapping(path = "/login", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String login() {

    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<User> list() {

    }
}
```

## Require role

But what if you need to make sure only some logged-in users can access a resource and others can't? For this situation, you can pass the expression `hasRole('ROLE_NAME')` to the `@PreAuthorize` annotation. In the following example, an authenticated user can access any of the methods, but only an authenticated user with the role of `admin` can access the `add()` method:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/locations")
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
public class LocationController {

    private LocationDAO dao;

    public LocationController() {
        dao = new MemoryLocationDAO();
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Location> list() {
        return dao.list();
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public Location get(@PathVariable int id) throws LocationNotFoundException {
        return dao.get(id);
    }

    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
    @RequestMapping(value = "", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public Location add(@Valid @RequestBody Location location) {
        return dao.create(location);
    }


}
```

If you need to allow for multiple roles, you can specify them in a comma-separated list using the expression `hasAnyRole`:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasAnyRole('ADMIN', 'USER')")
```
