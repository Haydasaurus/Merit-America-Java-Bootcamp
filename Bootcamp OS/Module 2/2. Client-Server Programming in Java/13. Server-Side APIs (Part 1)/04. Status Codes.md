# Status codes

By default, if no errors are encountered, handler methods respond with a status code of 200, but there may be times when you want to return a different status code than the default one. For example, many REST APIs return a status code of 201 on a successful `POST` and a status code of 204 on a successful `DELETE`.

To control the status code of the response, you add the `@ResponseStatus` annotation. Here's a handler method for `DELETE` requests that responds with a status code of 204:

```java
@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT)
@RequestMapping(path = "/products/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
public void delete(@PathVariable int id) {

    // Remove the product from underlying datastore

}
```

There may also be times when you want to return a different status code than the default due to an error. For example, if a user wanted to update the product with an ID of `13` and that ID wasn't in the database, you'd want to return a 404 status code.

You can do that by setting up a special exception that's linked to that status code with a `@ResponseStatus` annotation:

```java
@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class ProductNotFoundException extends Exception {}
```

In your controller, if the request resource wasn't found, you throw a `new ProductNotFoundException()` and the `404 NOT FOUND` status code is returned to the front-end code for you. This lets you handle errors the way you normally would in Java—using exceptions—and those exceptions are then reported as HTTP status codes.
