# What is REST?

You've learned how to build APIs, and more specifically, how to build Web Service APIs. These make your code and business logic available to other frontend and backend applications. While it may seem that the techniques you've learned are somewhat arbitrary, they all follow a common convention, like most web-based APIs. This convention is called "REST."

REST stands for **Representational State Transfer** and is a series of guidelines for defining Web Services that are flexible and usable by a wide range of services. Fundamentally, REST uses all the standard web technologies you've already learned: HTTP, URLs, and JSON. By building web services off of already widely adopted standards, REST allows you to tie APIs into existing applications.

REST APIs are based on the concept of "resources." Addresses (URLs) and actions (HTTP methods) both relate to those resources. A REST API uses HTTP status codes to inform clients about the results of calling the API.
