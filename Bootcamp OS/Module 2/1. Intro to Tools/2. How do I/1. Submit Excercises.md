# Submit exercises

Many of the exercises include automated tests. You can run these tests on your computer to check your work before you submit it. The same tests are also used by the automated grading system in Bootcamp OS.

You'll learn how to run the tests locally in the Intro to Tools unit. This guide assists you with submitting your work and having Bootcamp OS grade it.

After you've completed your work and all your tests pass locally, the process for submitting your exercises is to:
1.  Commit and push your work.
2.  Run tests in Bootcamp OS.
3.  Submit your work to Bootcamp OS.

## Step One: Commit and push your work
Whether you've finished working on your exercises or you're taking a break, it's a good idea to push your work to your student repository.

You'll find instructions on how to do this in the Intro to Tools: Git unit.

## Step Two: Run tests in Bootcamp OS
After your work is in your student repository, you're ready to run the tests in Bootcamp OS. Bootcamp OS requires you to provide the URL for the exercise in your student repository to download your code and run it against the tests.

### Copy your exercise URL
First, go to your student repository in Git. Navigate to the unit you're working on, and then go to the `exercise` folder within that unit. Copy the URL that you see in the browser address bar:

![Git repository](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/163682244-34c27373-e723-49f7-9903-c42d783d03d4.png)

> _Note: your page and URL may look different._

### Run tests in Bootcamp OS
Now, go to Bootcamp OS and in that same unit, look for the lesson titled **Exercise**:

Click on **Start Assessment**.

On the next page, there's an input box to enter your exercise URL. Click inside that box, and paste the URL that you copied previously.

Click **Run Tests**.

After a few moments, Bootcamp OS displays the results:

![Test Results dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94882786/163682339-6543eac8-f85e-4408-891d-00504ecdc586.png)

You'll see messages indicating the number of tests run and the number of failures. Verify that these numbers match what you saw when you ran the tests locally.

> _Note: the test results display may vary depending on the programming language and exercise. The number of passing or failing tests is always available._

## Step Three: Submit your work to Bootcamp OS
Once you're satisfied that your tests run correctly, you can submit your work to Bootcamp OS.

To submit your work:
1.  Make sure the URL of your repository is still in the input box.
2.  Press the **Submit** button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
3.  Click **Submit All Answers** in the confirmation dialog.
4.  After a few moments, you'll receive a message from Bootcamp OS.
5.  Then press the **Continue** button in the window that appears.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Warning: Remember to click "Submit"**

>Clicking **Run Tests** doesn't submit your exercise. You must click **Submit** in the upper right-hand corner to turn in your work.
