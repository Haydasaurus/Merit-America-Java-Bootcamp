# Why package managers?

Package managers are useful for many reasons:

-   They offer a simple and consistent way to install, uninstall, and upgrade software. You can install packages with a single command or click of a button.
-   They automatically install and handle dependencies, which saves you time.
-   You can install any published version of a package. Sometimes you'll find a library is only compatible with a specific version of another. It's also beneficial to keep all team members on the same version when developing software.
-   Because the packages are available online, you don't need to store the code from the packages in your source control. You only need to store the list of packages. This helps to save space in your source control repository.
-   They establish a shared convention for managing libraries. When new developers join a project or team, they may know how to use the package manager and can start contributing code sooner.
