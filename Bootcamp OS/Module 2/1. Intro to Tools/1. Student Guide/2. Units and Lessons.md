# Units and lessons

## Units
As mentioned on the previous page, a **unit** is a grouping of learning content for a single topic. You'll often focus on one unit at a time. In some situations, a unit exists as a pre-requisite for learning other topics.

The curriculum overview page shows your progress for each unit, with either your checkpoint score or a checkmark for units without checkpoints. If you're partially through a unit, it displays a progress bar and the remaining items left to complete:

When you open a unit, Bootcamp OS presents the unit's contents on the left sidebar:

A checkmark indicates that you've read a page. A star indicates the unit checkpoint.

## Lessons
In Bootcamp OS, each page of reading material is called a **lesson**. Units typically contain several lessons.

Lessons give you the information you need to start working with a topic. Each lesson explains how a particular topic fits into software development, what problem it solves in the real world, along with code samples to help you apply it.

The content in the lessons is enough to complete your tutorial, quiz, and exercise. They may include links to documentation or other references if you want to learn more about certain concepts.

In software development, there are often many techniques and options to solve a particular problem. Lessons won't describe all of these. Instead, they'll show you how to accomplish a task most understandably and straightforwardly. They're not the end. They're the starting point.
